THIS FILE IS NOW OUT OF DATE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

1. These examples will not build on Windows because of a 'bug' in distutils

    The -mno-cygwin option has been removed from the GCC compiler
    on the MinGW toolchain and this leads to compilation errors
    
    Fortunately the fix is simple:
    
    Edit 
        C:\Python25\Lib\distutils\cygwinccompiler.py
        C:\Python26\Lib\distutils\cygwinccompiler.py
        C:\Python27\Lib\distutils\cygwinccompiler.py
    and remove all references to the -mno-cygwin option


2. These examples will run with gcc/g++ provided the distutils.cfg file is setup, otherwise the
   Visual C/C++ compiler will be invoked.
