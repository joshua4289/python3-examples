Raw String 
-
 
Suppresses actual meaning of 
Escape characters. The syntax for raw 
strings 
is exactly the same as for normal strings with 
the exception of the raw string operator, the 
letter "r," which precedes the quotation 
marks. The "r" can be lowercase (r) or 
uppercase (R) and must be placed 
immediately preceding the first quote mark
.

String Formatting Operator
 
One of Python's coolest features is the string format operator
 
%
. This operator is 
unique to strings and makes up for 
the pack of having functions from C's printf() 
family. Following is a simple example:
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
print
 
"My name is %s and weight is %d kg!"
 
%
 
(
'Zara'
,
 
21
)
 
 
When the above code is executed, it produces the following result:
 
My
 
name 
is
 
Zara
 
and
 
weight 
is
 
21
 
kg
!
