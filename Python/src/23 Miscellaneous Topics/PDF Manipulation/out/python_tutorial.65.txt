Single Statement Suites
 
If the suite of an
 
if
 
clause consists only of a single line, it may go on the same line as 
the header statement.
 
Here is an example of a
 
one
-
line if
 
clause:
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
 
var
 
=
 
100
 
 
if
 
(
 
var
  
==
 
100
 
)
 
:
 
print
 
"Value of expression is 100"
 
print
 
"Good bye!"
 
When the above code is executed, it produces the following result:
 
Value
 
of expression 
is
 
100
 
Good
 
bye
!
