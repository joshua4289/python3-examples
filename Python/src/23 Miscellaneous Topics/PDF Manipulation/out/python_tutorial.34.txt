Multiple Assignment
 
Python allows you to assign a single value to several variables simultaneously. For 
example:
 
a 
=
 
b 
=
 
c 
=
 
1
 
Here, an integer object is created with the value 1, and all three variables are 
assigned to the same memory location. You can also assign multiple o
bjects to 
multiple variables. For example:
 
a
,
 
b
,
 
c 
=
 
1
,
 
2
,
 
"john"
 
Here, two integer objects with values 1 and 2 are assigned to variables a and b
 
respectively
, and one string object with the value "john" is assigned to the variable 
c.
 
Standard Data Types
 
The data stored in memory can be of many types. For example, a person's age is 
stored as a numeric value and his or her address is stored as alphanumeric 
characters. Python has various standard 
data 
types that are used to define the 
operations possible on
 
them and the storage method for each of them.
 
Python has five standard data types:
 

 
Numbers
 

 
String
 

 
List
 

 
Tuple
 

 
Dictionary
 
Python Numbers
 
Number data types store numeric values. 
Number objects are created when you 
assign a value to them. For example:
 
var1 
=
 
1
 
var2 
=
 
10
 
You can also delete the reference to a number object by using the
 
del
 
statement. The 
syntax of the del statement is:
