What is Exception?
 
An exception is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program
 
that 
d
isrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. In general, when a Python 
script encounters a situation that it can
no
t cope with, it raises an exception. An 
exception is a Python object that represents an error.
 
When a Python script raises an excep
tion, it must either handle the exception 
immediately otherwise it 
terminate
s
 
and 
quits
.
 
Handling an 
E
xception
 
If you have some
 
suspicious
 
code that may raise an exception, you can defend your 
program by placing the suspicious code in a
 
try:
 
block. After the try: block, include 
an
 
except:
 
statement, followed by a block of code which handles the problem as 
elegantly as possible.
