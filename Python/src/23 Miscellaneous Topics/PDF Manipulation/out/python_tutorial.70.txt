Using 
else Statement with Loops
 
Python supports to have an
 
else
 
statement 
associated with a loop statement.
 

 
If the
 
else
 
statement is used with a
 
for
 
loop, the
 
else
 
statement is executed 
when the loop has exhausted iterating the list.
 

 
If the
 
else
 
statement is used with a
 
while
 
loop, the
 
else
 
statement is executed 
when the 
condition becomes false.
 
The following example illustrates the combination of an else statement with a while 
statement that prints a number as long as it is less than 5, otherwise else statement 
gets executed.
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
 
count 
=
 
0
 
while
 
count 
<
 
5
:
 
   
print
 
count
,
 
" is  less than 5"
 
   
count 
=
 
count 
+
