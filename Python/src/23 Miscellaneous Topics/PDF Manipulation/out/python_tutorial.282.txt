You can use issubclass() or isinstance() functions to check a 
relationships of two 
classes and instances.
 

 
The
 
issubclass(sub, sup)
 
boolean function returns true if the given 
subclass
 
sub
 
is indeed a subclass of the superclass
 
sup
.
 

 
The
 
isinstance(obj, Class)
 
boolean function returns true if
 
obj
 
is an instance 
of class
 
Class
 
or is an instance of a subclass of Class
 
Overriding Methods
 
You can always override your parent class methods. One reason for overriding 
parent's methods is because you may want special or different functionality in your 
subclass.
 
Example
 
#!/usr/b
in/python
 
 
class
 
Parent
:
        
# define parent class
 
   
def
 
myMethod
(
self
):
 
      
print
 
'Calling parent method'
 
 
class
 
Child
(
Parent
):
 
# define child class
 
   
def
 
myMethod
(
self
):
 
      
print
 
'Calling child method'
 
 
c 
=
 
Child
()
          
# instance of child
 
c
.
myMethod
()
         
# child calls overridden method
 
When the above code is executed, it produces the following result:
 
Calling
 
child method
