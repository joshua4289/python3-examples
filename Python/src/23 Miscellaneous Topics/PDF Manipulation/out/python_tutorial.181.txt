A Python program can handle date 
and
 
time in several ways. Converting between 
date formats is a common chore for computers. Python's time and calendar modules 
help track dates and times.
 
What is Tick?
 
Time intervals are floating
-
point numbers in units of 
seconds. Particular instants in 
time are expressed in seconds since 12:00am, January 1, 1970(epoch).
 
There is a popular
 
time
 
module available in Python which provides functions for 
working with times
 
and for converting between representations. The 
functio
n
 
time.time()
 
returns the current system time in ticks since 12:00am, January 
1, 1970(epoch).
 
Example
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
import
 
time
;
  
# This is required to include time module.
 
 
ticks 
=
 
time
.
time
()
 
print
 
"Number of ticks since 12:00am, January 1, 1970:"
,
 
ticks
 
This would produce a result something as follows:
 
Number
 
of ticks since 
12
:
00am
,
 
January
 
1
,
 
1970
:
 
7186862.73399
 
Date arithmetic is easy to do with ticks. However, dates before the epoch cannot be 
represented in this form. Dates in the far future als
o cannot be represented this way 
-
 
the cutoff point is sometime in 2038 for UNIX and Windows.
 
What is TimeTuple?
 
Many of Python's time functions handle time as a tuple of 9 numbers, as shown 
below:
