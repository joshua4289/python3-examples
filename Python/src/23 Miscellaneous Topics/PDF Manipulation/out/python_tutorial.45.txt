==
 
I
f the value
s
 
of two operands are equal
, 
then 
the 
condition becomes true.
 
(a == b) is not true.
 
!=
 
I
f values 
of two operands 
are not equal
,
 
then condition becomes true.
 
(a != b) is true.
 
<>
 
I
f values 
of two operands 
are not equal
,
 
then condition becomes true.
 
(a <> b) is true. This is similar 
to != operator.
 
>
 
I
f the value of left operand is greater 
than the value of right operand, 
then 
condition becomes true.
 
(a > b) is not true.
 
<
 
I
f the value of left operand is less than 
the value of right operand, 
then 
condition becomes true.
 
(a < b) is true.
 
>=
 
I
f the value of left operand is greater 
than or equal to the value of right 
operand, 
then condition becomes true.
 
(
a >= b) is not true.
 
<=
 
I
f the value of left operand is less than 
or equal to the value of right operand, 
then condition becomes true.
 
(a <= b) is true.
 
Example
 
Assume variable a holds 10 and variable b holds 20, then:
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
 
a 
=
 
21
 
b 
=
 
10
 
c 
=
 
0
 
 
if
 
(
 
a 
==
 
b 
):
 
   
print
 
"Line 1 
-
 
a is equal to b"
