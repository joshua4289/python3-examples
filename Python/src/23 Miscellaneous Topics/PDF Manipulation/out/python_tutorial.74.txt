Good
 
bye
!
 
Here, we took the assistance of the len() built
-
in function, which provides the total 
number of elements in the tuple as 
well as the range() built
-
in function to give us the 
actual sequence to iterate over.
 
Using 
else Statement with Loops
 
Python supports to have an
 
else
 
statement associated with a loop statement.
 

 
If the
 
else
 
statement is used with a
 
for
 
loop, the
 
else
 
statement is executed 
when the loop has exhausted iterating the list.
 

 
If the
 
else
 
statement is used with a
 
while
 
loop, the
 
else
 
statement is executed 
when the condition becomes false.
 
The following example illustrates the combination of an else statement w
ith a for 
statement that searches for prime numbers from 10 through 20.
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
 
for
 
num 
in
 
range
(
10
,
20
):
  
#to iterate between 10 to 20
 
   
for
 
i 
in
 
range
(
2
,
num
):
 
#to iterate on the factors of the number
 
      
if
 
num
%
i 
==
 
0
:
      
#to determine the
 
first factor
 
         
j
=
num
/
i          
#to calculate the second factor
 
         
print
 
'%d equals %d * %d'
 
%
 
(
num
,
i
,
j
)
 
         
break
 
#to move to the next number, the #first FOR
 
   
else
:
                  
# else part of the loop
 
      
print
 
num
,
 
'is a prime
 
number'
 
When the above code is executed, it produces the following result:
 
10
 
equals 
2
