Passing Radio 
Button Data to CGI Program
 
Radio Buttons are used when only one option is required to be selected.
 
Here is example HTML code for a form with two radio buttons:
 
<form
 
action
=
"/cgi
-
bin/radiobutton.py"
 
method
=
"post"
 
target
=
"_blank"
>
 
<input
 
type
=
"radio"
 
name
=
"
subject"
 
value
=
"maths"
 
/>
 
Maths
 
<input
 
type
=
"radio"
 
name
=
"subject"
 
value
=
"physics"
 
/>
 
Physics
 
<input
 
type
=
"submit"
 
value
=
"Select Subject"
 
/>
 
</form>
 
The result of this code is the following form:
 
 
Maths
 
 
Physics
 
 
Bottom of Form
 
Below is 
radiobutton.py script to handle input given by web browser for radio button:
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
 
# Import modules for CGI handling 
 
import
 
cgi
,
 
cgitb 
 
 
# Create instance of FieldStorage 
 
form 
=
 
cgi
.
FieldStorage
()
 
 
 
# Get data from fields
 
if
 
form
.
getvalue
(
'subject'
):
