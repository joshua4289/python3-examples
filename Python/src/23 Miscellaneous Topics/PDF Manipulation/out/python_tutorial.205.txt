Example
 
The following
 
function takes a string as input parameter and prints it on standard 
screen.
 
def
 
printme
(
 
str 
):
 
   
"This prints a passed string into this 
function"
 
   
print
 
str
 
   
return
 
Calling a Function
 
Defining a function only gives it a name, specifies the parameters that are to be 
included in the function and structures the blocks of code.
 
Once the basic structure of a function is finalized, you can e
xecute it by calling it from 
another function or directly from the Python prompt. Following is the example to call 
printme() function:
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
 
# Function definition is here
 
def
 
printme
(
 
str 
):
 
   
"This prints a passed string into this function"
 
   
print
 
str
;
 
   
return
;
 
 
# Now you can call printme function
 
printme
(
"I'm first call to user defined function!"
);
 
printme
(
"Again second call to the same function"
);
 
When the above code is executed, it produces the following result:
 
I
'm first call to user 
defined function!
 
Again second call to the same function
