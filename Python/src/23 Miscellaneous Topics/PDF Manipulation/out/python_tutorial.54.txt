Identity operators

Operator
 
Description
 
Example
 
is
 
Evaluates to true if the variables on either side 
of the operator point to the same object and 
false otherwise.
 
x is y, here
 
is
 
results in 
1 if id(x) equals id(y).
 
is not
 
Evaluates to false if the variables on either 
side of the operator point to the same object 
and true otherwise.
 
x is not y, here
 
is 
not
 
results in 1 if id(x) is 
not equal to id(y).
 
Example
 
#!/usr/bin/python
