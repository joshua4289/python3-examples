Sending Attachments as an 
E
-
mail
 
To send an e
-
mail with mixed content requires to set
 
Content
-
type
 
header 
to
multipart/mixed
. 
Then, text and attachment sections can be specified 
within
 
boundaries
.
 
A boundary is started with two hyphens followed by a unique number, which can
not 
appear in the message part of the e
-
mail. A final boundary denoting the e
-
mail's final 
section must als
o end with two hyphens.
 
Attached files should be encoded with the
 
pack("m")
 
function to have base64 
encoding before transmission.
 
Example
 
Following is the example, which 
send
s
 
a file
 
/tmp/test.txt
 
as an attachment. Try it 
once:
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
 
import smtplib
 
import base64
 
 
filename = "/tmp/test.txt"
 
 
# Read a file and encode it into base64 format
 
fo = open(filename, "rb")
 
filecontent = fo.read()
 
encodedcontent = base64.b64encode(filecontent)  # base64
 
 
sender = 'webmaster@tutorialpoint.com'
