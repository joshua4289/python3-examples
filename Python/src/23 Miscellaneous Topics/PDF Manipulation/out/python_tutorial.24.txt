The number of spaces in the indentation is variable, but all statements within the 
block must be indented the same amount. 
For example
:
 
if
 
True
:
 
    
print
 
"True"
 
else
:
 
  
print
 
"False"
 
However, the 
following 
block 
generate
s
 
an error:
 
if
 
True
:
 
    
print
 
"Answer"
 
    
print
 
"True"
 
else
:
 
    
print
 
"Answer"
 
  
print
 
"False"
 
Thus, in Python all the 
continuous
 
lines indented with 
same 
number of spaces would 
form a block. 
The

example ha

various statement blocks:

understood various blocks even if they are 
without braces.
