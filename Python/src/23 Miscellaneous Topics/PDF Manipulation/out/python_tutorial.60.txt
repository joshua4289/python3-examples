if...else statements
 
if statement
 
can be followed by an 
optional
 
else statement
, which executes when 
the boolean expression is 
FALSE
.
 
nested if statements
 
You can use one
 
if
 
or
 
else if
 
statement inside 
another
 
if
 
or
 
else if
 
statement(s).
 
 
Let us go 
through each decision making briefly:
 
If Statement
 
It
 
is similar to that of other languages. The
 
if
 
statement contains a logical expression 
using which data is compared and a decision is made based on the result of the 
comparison.
 
Syntax
 
if
 
expression
:
 
   
statement
(
s
)
 
If the boolean
 
expression
 
evaluates to
 
TRUE
, then the block of statement(s) inside 
the if statement 
is
 
executed. If boolean expression evaluates to
 
FALSE
, then the first 
set of code after the end of the if statement(s) 
is
 
executed.
