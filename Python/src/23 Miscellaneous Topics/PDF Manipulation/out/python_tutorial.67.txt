You can use one or more loop inside any another while, for 
or do..while loop.
 
While Loop
 
A
 
while
 
loop statement in Python programming language repeatedly executes a 
target statement as long as a given conditi
on is true.
 
Syntax
 
The syntax of a
 
while
 
loop in Python programming language is:
 
while
 
expression
:
 
   
statement
(
s
)
 
Here,
 
statement(s)
 
may be a single statement or a block of statements. 
The
 
condition
 
may be any expression, and true is any non
-
zero value. 
The loop 
iterates while the condition is true.
 
When the condition becomes false, program control passes to the line immediately 
following the loop.
 
In Python, all the statements indented by the same number of character spaces after 
a programming construct 
are considered to be part of a single block of code. Python 
uses indentation as its method of grouping statements.
