Dictionaries have no concept of order among elements. It is incorrect to say that the 
elements are "out of order"; they are simply 
unordered.
 
Data Type Conversion
 
Sometimes, you may need to perform conversions between the built
-
in types. To 
convert between types, you simply use the type name as a function.
 
There are several built
-
in functions to perform conversion from one data type 
to 
another. These functions return a new object representing the converted value.
