)
 
print
 
"returned tuple: %s "
 
%
 
struct_time

Description
 
The method
 
time()
 
returns the time as a floating point number expressed in seconds

systems provide time with a better precision than 1 second. While this functi
on 
normally returns non
-
decreasing values, it can return a lower value than a previous 
call if the system clock has been set back between the two calls.
