The try
-
finally 
C
lause
 
You can use a
 
finally:
 
block along with a
 
try:
 
block. The finally block is a place to put 
any code that must execute, whether the try
-
block raised an exception or not. The 
syntax of the try
-
finally statement is this:
 
try
:
 
   
You
 
do
 
your operations here
;
 
   
......................
 
   
Due
 
to any exception
,
 
this
 
may be skipped
.
 
finally
:
 
   
This
 
would always be executed
.
 
   
......................
 
Note that you can provide except clause(s), or a finally clause, but not both. You 
can
not u
se
 
else
 
clause as well along with a finally clause.
 
Example
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
 
try
:
 
   
fh 
=
 
open
(
"testfile"
,
 
"w"
)
 
   
fh
.
write
(
"This is my test file for exception handling!!"
)
 
finally
:
 
   
print
 
"Error: can
\
't find file or read data"
 
If you do not have 
permission to open the file in writing mode, then this will produce 
the following result:
 
Error
:
 
can
't find file or read data
 
Same example can be written more cleanly as follows:
 
#!/usr/bin/python
