Return Value
 
This method returns true if the file is connected (is associated with a terminal device) 
to a tty(
-
like) device, else false.
 
Example
 
The following 
example shows the usage of isatty() method.
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
 
# Open a file
 
fo 
=
 
open
(
"foo.txt"
,
 
"wb"
)
 
print
 
"Name of the file: "
,
 
fo
.
name
 
 
ret 
=
 
fo
.
isatty
()
 
print
 
"Return value : "
,
 
ret
 
 
# Close opend file
 
fo
.
close
()
 
When we run above program, it 
produces following result:
 
Name of the file:  foo.txt
 
Return value :  False
 
5.
 
File.next()
 
Description
 
The method
 
next()
 
is used when a file is used as an iterator, typically in a loop, the 
next() method is called repeatedly. This method returns the next 
input line, or 
raises
 
StopIteration
 
when EOF is hit.
 
Combining next() method with other file methods like
 
readline()
 
does not work right. 
However, using
seek()
 
to reposition the file to an absolute position will flush the read
-
ahead buffer.
