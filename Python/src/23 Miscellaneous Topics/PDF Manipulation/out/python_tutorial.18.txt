Pyth
on Environment Variables
 
Here are important environment variables, which can be recognized by Python:
 
Variable
 
Description
 
PYTHONPATH
 
It 
h
as a role similar to PATH. This variable tells the Python 
interpreter where to locate the module files 
import
ed
 
into a 
program. 
It
 
should include the Python source library 
directory and the directories containing 
Python source code. 
PYTHONPATH is sometimes preset by the Python installer.
 
PYTHONSTARTUP
 
It 
c
ontains the path of an initialization file 
containing Python 
source code
.
 
It
 
is executed every time you start the 
interpreter
.
 
It is
 
named 
as 
.pythonrc.py in Unix
 
and it
 
contains commands that load utilities or modify 
PYTH
ONPATH.
 
PYTHONCASEOK
 
It is 
u
sed in Windows to instruct Python to find the first case
-
insensitive match in an import statement. Set this variable 
to any value to activate it.
 
PYTHONHOME
 
It is 
a
n alternative module search path. It
 
i
s usually 
embedded in
 
the PYTHONSTARTUP or PYTHONPATH 
directories to make switching module libraries easy.
 
Running Python
 
There are three different ways to start Python:
 
(1) Interactive Interpreter
 
You can 
start
 
Python from Unix, DOS, or any other system
 
that
 
provides you a 
command
-
line interpreter or shell window.
 
E
nter
 
python
 
the command line.
 
S
tart coding right away in the interactive interpreter
.
 
 
$python             
# Unix/Linux
 
or
 
 
python
%
             
# Unix/Linux
