The
 
read()
 
Method
 
The
 
read()
 
method reads a string from an open file. It is important to note that 
Python stri
ngs can have binary data
, 
apart from
 
text
 
data
.
 
Syntax
 
fileObject.read([count]);
 
Here, passed parameter is the number of bytes to be read from the opened file. This 
method starts reading from the beginning of the file and if
 
count
 
is missing,
 
then it 
tries to read as much as possible, maybe until the end of file.
 
Example
 
Let
 
u
s take a file
 
foo.txt
, which we 
created above.
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
 
# Open a file
 
fo = open("foo.txt", "r+")
 
str = fo.read(10);
 
print "Read String is : ", str
 
# 
Close opend file
 
fo.close()
 
This 
produce
s
 
the following result:
 
Read String is :  Python is
