Failing to give necessary information to consumers 4.7 It is a breach of the CPRs for businesses to mislead consumers by failing to give them the information they need in order to make an informed 
decision, where this causes or is likely to cause the average consumer to take a different transactional decision. This is known as a misleading 
omission (regulation 6). 4.8 This might, for example, occur by leaving out or hiding important information, or providing important information in an unclear,
