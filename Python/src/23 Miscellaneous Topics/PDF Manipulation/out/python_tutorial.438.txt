Anchors
 
Anchors are used to define where text is positioned relative to a reference point.
 
Here is list of possible constants, which can be used for Anchor attribute.

N

W

CENTER

E

SW
 
74.
 
S
 
75.
 
SE
 
For 
example, if you use CENTER as a text anchor, the text will be centered 
horizontally and vertically around the reference point.
 
Anchor NW will position the text so that the reference point coincides with the 
northwest (top left) corner of the box containing
 
the text.
 
Anchor W will center the text vertically around the reference point, with the left edge 
of the text box passing through that point, and so on.
 
If you create a small widget inside a large frame and use the anchor=SE option, the 
widget will be pla
ced in the bottom right corner of the frame. If you used anchor=N 
instead, the widget would be centered along the top edge.
