Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is a protocol, which handles sending e
-
mail and 
routing e
-
mail 
between mail servers.
 
Python provides
 
smtplib
 
module, which defines an SMTP client session object that 
can be used to send mail to any Internet machine with an SMTP or ESMTP listener 
daemon.
 
Here is a simple syntax to create one SMTP object, which can late
r be used to send 
an e
-
mail:
 
import smtplib
 
smtpObj = smtplib.SMTP( [host [, port [, local_hostname]]] )
 
Here is the detail of the parameters:
 

 
host:
 
This is the host running your SMTP server. You can specif
y IP address of 
the host or a domain name like 
tutorialspoint.com. This is optional argument.
 

 
port:
 
If you are providing
 
host
 
argument, then you need to specify a port, 
where SMTP server is listening. Usually this port would be 25.
 

 
local_hostname
: If your SMTP server is running on your local machine, t
hen 
you can specify just
 
localhost
 
as of this option.
 
An SMTP object has an instance method called
 
sendmail
, which 
is
 
typically 
used to 
do the work of mailing a message. It takes three parameters:
 

 
The
 
sender
 
-
 
A string with the address of the sender
.
 

 
The
 
receivers
 
-
 
A list of strings, one for each recipient.
 

 
The
 
message
 
-
 
A message as a string formatted as specified in the various 
RFCs.
 
Example
 
Here is a simple way to send one e
-
mail using Python script. Try it once:
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
import 
smtplib
 
sender = 'from@fromdomain.com'
