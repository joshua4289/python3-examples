History of Python
 
Python was developed b
y Guido van Rossum in the late eighties and early nineties at 
the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the 
Netherlands.
 
Python is derived from many other languages, including ABC, Modula
-
3, C, C++, 
Algol
-
68, SmallTalk, 
Un
ix shell
,
 
and other scripting languages.
 
Python is copyrighted. Like Perl, Python source code is now available under the GNU 
General Public License (GPL).
 
Python is now maintained by a core development team at the institute, although 
Guido van Rossum still
 
holds a vital role in directing its progress.
