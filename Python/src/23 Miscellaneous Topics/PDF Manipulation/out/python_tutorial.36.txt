Python allows you to use a lowercase L with long, but it is recommended that 
you use only an 
uppercase L to avoid confusion with the number 1. Python 
displays long integers with an uppercase L.
 

 
A complex number consists of an ordered pair of real floating
-
point numbers 
denoted by 
x
 
+ 
y
j, where 
x
 
is the real part and b is the imaginary part of t
he 
complex number.
 
Python Strings
 
Strings in Python are identified as a contiguous set of characters 
represented in
 
the
 
quotation marks. Python allows for either pairs of single or double quotes. Subsets 
of strings can be taken using the slice 
operator (
[ ] and [
:
] ) with indexes starting at 
0 in the beginning of the string and working their way from 
-
1 at the end.
 
The plus (
+
) sign is the string concatenation operator and the asterisk (
*
) is the 
repetition operator. For example:
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
 
str 
=
 
'Hello World!'
 
print
 
str          
# Prints complete string
 
print
 
str
[
0
]
       
# Prints first character of the string
 
print
 
str
[
2
:
5
]
     
# Prints characters starting from 3rd to 5th
 
print
 
str
[
2
:]
      
# Prints string starting from 
3rd character
 
print
 
str 
*
 
2
      
# Prints string two times
 
print
 
str 
+
 
"TEST"
 
# Prints concatenated string
 
This will produce the following result:
 
Hello
 
World
!
 
H
 
llo
 
llo 
World
!
 
Hello
 
World
!
Hello
 
World
!
