The
 
elif
 
Statement
 
The
 
elif
 
statement allows you to check multiple expressions for 
TRUE 
and execute a 
block of code as soon as one of the conditions evaluates to TRUE.
 
Similar to
 
the
 
else
, the
 
elif
 
statement is optional. However, unlike
 
else
, for which 
there can be at most one statem
ent, there can be an arbitrary number 
of
 
elif
 
statements following an
 
if
.
