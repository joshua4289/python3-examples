Delete Dictionary Elements
 
You can either remove individual dictionary elements or clear
 
the entire contents of 
a dictionary. You can also delete entire dictionary in a single operation.
 
To explicitly remove an entire dictionary, just use the
 
del
 
statement. Fo
r 
example:
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
 
dict 
=
 
{
'Name'
:
 
'Zara'
,
 
'Age'
:
 
7
,
 
'Class'
:
 
'First'
};
 
 
del
 
dict
[
'Name'
];
 
# remove entry with key 'Name'
 
dict
.
clear
();
     
# remove all entries in dict
 
del
 
dict 
;
        
# delete entire dictionary
 
 
print
 
"dict['Age']: "
,
 
dict
[
'Age'
];
 
print
 
"dict['School']: "
,
 
dict
[
'School'
];
 
This 
produce
s
 
the following result. Note 
that 
an exception 
is 
raised
 
because after
 
del 
dict
,
 
dictionary does not exist any
more:
 
dict
[
'Age'
]:

dict

Note:
 
del() method is discussed in subsequent section.
 
Properties of Dictionary Keys
 
Dictionary values have no restrictions. They can be any arbitrary Python object, either 
standard objects or user
-
defined ob
jects. However, same is not true for the keys.
 
There are two important points to remember about dictionary keys:
