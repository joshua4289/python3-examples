This 
prompt
s
 
you to enter any string and it would display same string on the screen. 
When I typed "Hello Python!", its output is like this:
 
Enter your input: Hello Python
 
Receiv
ed input is :  Hello Python
 
The
 
input
 
Function
 
The
 
input([prompt])
 
function is equivalent to raw_input, except that it assumes the 
input is a valid Python expression and returns the evaluated result to you.
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
 
str = input("Enter your input
: ");
 
print "Received input is : ", str
 
This would produce the following result against the entered input:
 
Enter your input: [x*5 for x in range(2,10,2)]
 
Recieved input is :  [10, 20, 30, 40]
 
Opening and Closing Files
 
Until now, you have been reading and writing to the standard input and output. Now, 
we will see how to 
use
 
actual data files.
 
Python provides basic functions and methods necessary to manipulate files by 
default. You can do your most of the file ma
nipulation using a
 
file
 
object.
 
The
 
open
 
Function
 
Before you can read or write a file, you have to open it using Python's built
-
in
 
open()
function. This function creates a
 
file
 
object, which would be utilized to call 
other support methods associated with i
t.
 
Syntax
 
file object = open(file_name [, access_mode][, buffering])
