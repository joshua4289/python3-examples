Setting up PATH
 
Programs and other executable file
s can 
be
 
in many directories, so operating systems 
provide a search path that lists the directories that the OS searches for executables.
 
The path is stored in an environment variable, which is a named string maintained 
by the operating system. Th
is
 
variable
 
contain
s
 
information available to the command 
shell and other programs.
 
The
 
path
 
variable is named 
as 
PATH in Unix or Path in Windows (Unix is case
-
sensitive; Windows is not).
 
In Mac OS, the installer handles the path details. To invoke the Pyth
on interpreter 
from any particular directory, you must add the Python directory to your path.
 
Setting path at Unix/Linux
 
To add the Python directory to the path for a particular session in Unix:
 

 
In the csh shell:
 
type
 
setenv PATH 
"$PATH:/usr/local/bin/python" and press 
Enter.
 

 
In the bash shell (Linux):
 
type
 
export 
ATH="$PATH:/usr/local/bin/python" 
and press Enter.
 

 
In the sh or ksh shell:
 
type
 
PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/bin/python" and press 
Enter.
 

 
Note:
 
/usr/local/bin/python is the 
path of the Python directory
 
Setting path at Windows
 
To add the Python directory to the path for a particular session in Windows:
 
At the command prompt

path %path%;C:
