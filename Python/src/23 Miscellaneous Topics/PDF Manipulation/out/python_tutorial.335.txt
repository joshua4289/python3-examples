The
 
socket
 
Module
 
To create a socket, you must use the
 
socket.socket()
 
function available 
in
 
socket
 
module, which has the general syntax:
 
s = socket.socket (socket_family, socket_type, protocol=0)
 
Here is the 
description of the parameters:
 

 
socket_family:
 
This is either AF_UNIX or AF_INET, as explained earlier.
 

 
socket_type:
 
This is either SOCK_STREAM or SOCK_DGRAM.
 

 
protocol:
 
This is usually left out, defaulting to 0.
 
Once you have
 
socket
 
object, then you can use
 
required functions to create your 
client or server program. Following is the list of functions required:
