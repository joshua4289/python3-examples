This chapter 
cover

all the basic I/O functions available in Python. For more functions, 
please refer to standard Python documentation.
 
Printing to the Screen
 
The simplest way to 
produce output is using the
 
print
 
statement where you can pass 
zero or more expressions separated by commas. This function converts the 
expressions you pass into a string and writes the result to standard output as follows:
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
 
print "Python
 
is really a great language,", "isn't it?";
 
This 
produce
s
 
the following result on your standard screen:
 
Python is really a great language, isn't it?
 
Reading Keyboard Input
 
Python provides two built
-
in functions to read a line of text from standard i
nput, 
which by default comes from the keyboard. These functions are:
 

 
raw_input
 

 
input
 
The
 
raw_input
 
Function
 
The
 
raw_input([prompt])
 
function reads one line from standard input and returns it 
as a string (removing the trailing newline).
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
 
str = raw_input("Enter your input: ");
 
print "Received input is : ", str
 
16.
