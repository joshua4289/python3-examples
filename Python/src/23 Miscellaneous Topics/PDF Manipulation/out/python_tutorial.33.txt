Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. This means 
 
when you create a variable
,
 
you reserve some space in memory.
 
Based on the data type of a variable, the interpreter 
allocates memory and decides 
what can be stored in the reserved memory. Therefore, by assigning different data 
types to variables, you can store integers, decimals
,
 
or characters in these variables.
 
Assigning Values to Variables
 
Python variables do not 
need 
explicit
 
declar
ation
 
to reserve memory space. The 
declaration happens automatically when you assign a value to a variable. The equal 
sign (=) is used to assign values to variables.
 
The operand to the left of the = operator is the name of 
the variable and the operand 
to the right of the = operator is the value stored in the variable. For example:
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
 
counter 
=
 
100
          
# An integer assignment
 
miles   
=
 
1000.0
       
# A floating point
 
name    
=
 
"John"
       
# A string
 
 
print
 
counter
 
print
 
miles
 
print
 
name
 
Here, 100, 1000.0
,
 
and "John" are the values assigned 
to
 
counter
,
 
miles
,
 
and
 
name
 
variables
 
respectively. 
T
his 
produce
s
 
the following 
result:
 
100
 
1000.0
 
John
