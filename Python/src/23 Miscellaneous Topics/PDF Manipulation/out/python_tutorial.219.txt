The dir( ) Function
 
The dir() built
-
in function returns a sorted list of strings containing the names defined 
by a module.
 
The list contains the names of all the modules, variables and functio
ns that are 
defined in a module. Following is a simple example:
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
 
# Import built
-
in module math
 
import
 
math
 
 
content 
=
 
dir
(
math
)
 
 
print
 
content
;
