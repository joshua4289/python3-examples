file downloadable from a given link, then 
its syntax 
is
 
as follows:
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
 
# HTTP Header
 
print
 
"Content
-
Type:application/octet
-
stream; name=
\
"FileName
\
"
\
r
\
n"
;
 
print
 
"Content
-
Disposition: attachment; filename=
\
"FileName
\
"
\
r
\
n
\
n"
;
 
 
# Actual File Content will go hear.
 
fo 
=
 
open
(
"foo.txt"
,
 
"rb"
)
 
 
str 
=
 
fo

print
 
str
 
 
# Close opend file
