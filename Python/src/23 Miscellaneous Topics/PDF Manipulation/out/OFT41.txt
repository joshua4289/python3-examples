undertake checks, you will need to be able to show that you were justified in making that decision and that it was reasonable in the 
particular circumstances for you to act in that way. Similarly, where 
you rely on others for information, you need to be able to show that 
it was reasonable for you to rely on them and to the extent that you 
did. For example, while it may be reasonable for you to rely on some 
information supplied to you at the outset of the instruction process 
by your client, if later on you discover reasons to doubt its accuracy, 
you should take appropriate steps to check whether the original information supplied is indeed correct. When you conduct your business (general considerations about criminal offences under the regulations) 5.5 There is a defence of due diligence to some criminal offences under the CPRs (misleading actions, misleading omissions, aggressive practices and virtually all of the specific banned practices) and BPRs (misleading advertising). In order to prove that you have behaved with due diligence, you need to show both:  that you committed the offence because of: - a mistake or - reliance on information supplied to you by someone else or - the act or default of someone else or - an accident or - another cause outside your control  and that you took all reasonable precautions and exercised all due diligence to avoid committing the offence.4040 The requirements in this bullet are similar to those that are well-known already from the Property Misdescriptions Act 1991 (PMA). The courts may draw on PMA case law when considering the due diligence defence under the CPRs and BPRs.
