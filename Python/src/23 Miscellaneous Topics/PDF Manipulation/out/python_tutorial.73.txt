Iterating by Sequence Index
 
An alternative way of iterating 
through each item is by index offset into the sequence 
itself. Following is a simple example:
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
 
fruits 
=
 
[
'banana'
,
 
'apple'
,
  
'mango'
]
 
for
 
index 
in
 
range
(
len
(
fruits
)):
 
   
print
 
'Current fruit :'
,
 
fruits
[
index
]
 
 
print
 
"Good bye!"
 
When the 
above code is executed, it produces the following result:
 
Current
 
fruit 
:
 
banana
