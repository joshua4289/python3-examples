The Common Gateway Interface, or CGI, is a set of standards that define how 
information is 
exchanged between the web server and a custom script.
 
The CGI specs 
are currently maintained by the NCSA and NCSA.
 
What is CGI?
 

 
The Common Gateway Interface, or CGI, is a standard for external gateway 
programs to interface with information servers such as HTTP servers.
 

 
The curren
t version is CGI/1.1 and CGI/1.2 is under progress.
 
Web Browsing
 
To understand the concept of CGI, let
 
u
s see what happens when we click a hyper 
link to browse a particular web page or URL.
 

 
Your browser contacts the HTTP web server and demands for the URL
,
 
i.e., 
filename.
 

 
Web Server 
parse
s
 
the URL and 
look
s
 
for the filename
.
 
I
f it finds that file then 
sends it back to the browser, otherwise sends an error message indicating that 
you 
requested a wrong file.
 

 
Web browser takes response from 
web server and displays either the received 
file or error message.
 
However, it is possible to set up the HTTP server so that whenever a file in a certain 
directory is requested that file is not sent back; instead it is executed as a program, 
and whatever t
hat program outputs is sent back for your browser to display. This 
function is called the Common Gateway Interface or CGI and the programs are called 
CGI scripts. These CGI programs can be a Python Script, PERL Script, Shell Script, C 
or C++ program, etc.
