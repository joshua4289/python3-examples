selectcolor
 
The color of the radiobutton when it is set. Default is red.
 
selectimage
 
If you are using the image option to display a graphic instead 
of text when the radiobutton is
 
cleared, you can set the 
selectimage option to a different image that will be displayed 
when the radiobutton is set.
 
state
 
The default is state=NORMAL, but you can set 
state=DISABLED to gray out the control and make it 
unresponsive. If the cursor is curr
ently over the radiobutton, 
the state is ACTIVE.
 
text
 
The label displayed next to the radiobutton. Use newlines 
("
\
n") to display multiple lines of text.
 
textvariable
 
To slave the text displayed in a label widget to a control 
variable of class
 
StringVar
,
 
set this option to that variable.
 
underline
 
You can display an underline (_) below the nth letter of the 
text, counting from 0, by setting this option to n. The default 
is underline=
-
1, which means no underlining.
 
value
 
When a radiobutton is turned on b
y the user, its control 
variable is set to its current value option. If the control 
variable is an
 
IntVar
, give each radiobutton in the group a 
different integer value option. If the control variable is 
a
 
StringVar
, give each radiobutton a different string
 
value 
option.
 
variable
 
The control variable that this radiobutton shares with the 
other radiobuttons in the group. This can be either an IntVar 
or a StringVar.
 
width
 
Width of the label in characters (not pixels!). If this option is 
not set, the label wi
ll be sized to fit its contents.
 
wraplength
 
You can limit the number of characters in each line by setting 
this option to the desired number. The default value, 0, means 
that lines will be broken only at newlines.
