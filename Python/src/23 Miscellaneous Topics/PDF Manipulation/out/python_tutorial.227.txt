The
 
close()
 
Method
 
The close() method of a
 
file
 
object fl
ushes any unwritten information and closes the 
file object, after which no more writing can be done.
 
Python automatically closes a file when the reference object of a file is reassigned to 
another file. It is a good practice to use the close() method to cl
ose a file.
 
Syntax
 
fileObject.close();
 
Example
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
 
# Open a file
 
fo = open("foo.txt", "wb")
 
print "Name of the file: ", fo.name
