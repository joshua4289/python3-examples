When the above code is executed, it produces the following result:
 
list1
[

]:
  
physics

Updating Lists
 
You can update single or multiple elements of lists by giving the slice on the left
-
hand 
side of the assignment operator, and you can add to elements in a list with the 
append() method. Fo
r
 
example:
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
 
list 
=
 
[
'physics'
,
 
'chemistry'
,
 
1997
,
 
2000
];
 
 
print
 
"Value available at index 2 : "
 
print
 
list
[
2
];
 
list
[
2
]
 
=
 
2001
;
 
print
 
"New value available at index 2 : "
 
print
 
list
[
2
];
 
Note:
 
append() method is discussed in 
subsequent section.
 
When the above code is executed, it produces the following result:
 
Value
 
available at index 
2
 
:
 
1997
 
New
 
value available at index 
2
 
:
 
2001
