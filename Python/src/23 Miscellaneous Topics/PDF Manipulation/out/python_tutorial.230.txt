File Positions
 
The
 
tell()
 
method tells you the current position within the file; in other words, the 
next read or write will occur at that many bytes from th
e beginning of the file.
 
The
 
seek(offset[, from])
 
method changes the current file position. 
The
 
offset
 
argument indicates the number of bytes to be moved. The
 
from
 
argument 
specifies the reference position from where the bytes are to be moved.
 
If
 
from
 
is s
et to 0, it means use the beginning of the file as the reference position 
and 1 means use the current position as the reference position and if it is set to 2 
then the end of the file would be taken as the reference position.
 
Example
 
Let
 
u
s take a file
 
foo.txt
, which we 
created above.
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
 
# Open a file
 
fo = open("foo.txt", "r+")
 
str = fo.read(10);
 
print "Read String is : ", str
 
 
# Check current position
 
position = fo.tell();
 
print "Current file position : ", position
 
 
# Reposition poi
nter at the beginning once again
 
position = fo.seek(0, 0);
 
str = fo.read(10);
 
print "Again read String is : ", str
 
# Close opend file
 
fo.close()
