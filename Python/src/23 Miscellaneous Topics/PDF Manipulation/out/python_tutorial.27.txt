You can type 
a
 
comment 
on the same line after a statement or expre
ssion:
 
name 
=
 
"Madisetti"
 
# This is again comment
 
You can comment multiple lines as follows:
 
# This is a comment.
 
# This is a comment, too.
 
# This is a comment, too.
 
# I said that already.
 
Using Blank Lines
 
A line containing only whitespace, possibly with
 
a comment, is known as a blank line 
and Python totally ignores it.
 
In an interactive interpreter session, you must enter an empty physical line to 
terminate a multiline statement.
 
Waiting for the User
 
The following line of the program displays the prompt
, 

Press 
the enter key to exit

 
and waits for the user to 
take action
:
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
raw_input
(
"
\
n
\
nPress the enter key to exit."
)
 
Here, "
\
n
\
n" 
is
 
used to create two new lines before displaying the 
actual line. Once 
the user presses the key, the program ends. This is a nice trick to keep a console 
window open until the user is done with an application.
