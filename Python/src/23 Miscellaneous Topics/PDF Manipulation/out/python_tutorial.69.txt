The block here, consisting of the print and increment statements, is 
executed 
repeatedly until count is no longer less than 9. With each iteration, the current value 
of the index count is displayed and then increased by 1.
 
The Inf
inite Loop
 
A loop becomes infinite loop if a condition never becomes 
FALSE
. You must use 
cautio
n when using while loops because of the possibility that this condition never 
resolves to a 
FALSE 
value. This results in a loop that never ends. Such a loop is called 
an infinite loop.
 
An infinite loop might be useful in client/server programming where the
 
server needs 
to run continuously so that client programs can communicate with it as and when 
required.
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
 
var
 
=
 
1
 
while
 
var
 
==
 
1
 
:
  
# This constructs an infinite loop
 
   
num 
=
 
raw_input
(
"Enter a number  :"
)
 
   
print
 
"You entered: "
,
 
num
 
 
print
 
"Good bye!"
 
When the above code is executed, it produces the following result:
 
Enter
 
a number  
:
20
