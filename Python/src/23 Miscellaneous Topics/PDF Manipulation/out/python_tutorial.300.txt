CGI Architecture 
 
 
Web Server Support 
and
 
Configuration
 
Before you proceed with CGI Programming, make sure that your Web Server supports 
CGI and it is configured to handle CGI Programs. All the CGI Programs to be executed 
by the HTTP server are ke
pt in a pre
-
configured directory. This directory is called CGI 
Directory and by convention it is named as /var/www/cgi
-
bin. By convention, CGI 
files 
have extension as
.cgi
, but you can keep your files with python extension
 
.py
 
as 
well.
 
By default, the 
Linux server is configured to run only the scripts in the cgi
-
bin 
directory in /var/www. If you want to specify any other directory to run your CGI 
scripts, comment the following lines in the httpd.conf file:
 
<Directory
 
"/var/www/cgi
-
bin"
>
 
   
AllowOverride
 
None
