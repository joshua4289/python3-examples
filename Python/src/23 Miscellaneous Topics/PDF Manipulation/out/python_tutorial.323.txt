If a connection is established with the datasource, then a Connection Object is 
returned and saved into
 
db
 
for further use, otherwise
 
db
 
is set to None. 
Next,
 
db
 
object is used to create a
 
cursor
 
object, which in turn is used to execute 
SQL queries. Finally, before coming out, it ensures that database connection is closed 
and resources are released.
 
Creating Database Table
 
Once a database connection is established, we are ready to create t
ables or records 
into the database tables using
 
execute
 
method of the created cursor.
 
Example
 
L
et
 
u
s create Database table EMPLOYEE:
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
 
import MySQLdb
 
 
# Open database connection
 
db = MySQLdb.connect("localhost","testuser","test12
3","TESTDB" )
 
 
# prepare a cursor object using cursor() method
 
cursor = db.cursor()
 
 
# Drop table if it already exist using execute() method.
 
cursor.execute("DROP TABLE IF EXISTS EMPLOYEE")
 
 
# Create table as per requirement
 
sql = """CREATE TABLE EMPLOYEE 
(
 
         
FIRST_NAME  CHAR(20) NOT NULL,
 
         
LAST_NAME  CHAR(20),
 
         
AGE INT,
