What action might a consumer take? 6.9 In addition to the points above, a consumer may take their specific complaint against you to an approved redress scheme.526.10 Consumers may also have private rights of legal redress which they can enforce through the civil courts. Any action by a consumer does not prevent a consumer enforcement body from taking its own enforcement 
action.  If the complaint is upheld, you may be required to apologise to the complainant and/or 
pay compensation of up to Â£25,000. A serious breach of legislation 
and/or a recognised standard (for example a code of practice) could also 
lead to your dismissal from the approved redress scheme. As it is a legal requirement for you to belong to such a scheme, you would no longer be 
able to trade as an estate agent. See Annexe B for more information on redress schemes. 6.11 Negative consumer feedback can of course also lead to reputational 
issues and loss of business.  52 If you are a solicitor providing estate agency services and you are exempt from the duty to join an approved redress scheme, the consumer may complain instead to a legal ombudsman, which will have its own disciplinary procedures and sanctions that it may impose on you.
