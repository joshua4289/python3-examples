 Transactional decision Consumers need to be able to make informed decisions when dealing with a business carrying on a commercial practice. The CPRs express this concept as the 'transactional decision'. A transactional decision can include a decision to find out more about your services, or to rule out using the services of one of your competitors. It is a very broad concept, and is not limited to decisions with financial consequences. A transactional decision means any decision taken by a consumer concerning:  whether to purchase a product18 whether or not to pay in whole or part for a product   whether or not to retain or dispose of a product  whether or not to exercise some contractual right, and/or  how, and on what terms, to do these things.19Your commercial practices Œ for example your market appraisal, description of property for sale or the advice you give during negotiations Œ can affect consumers' transactional decisions, for example:   a client's decision whether and on what terms to sign or renew an agreement with you, or their decision to end an agreement  a seller's decision whether to put their property up for sale or take it off the market, to accept or turn down an offer, or to complete on the sale or not  a buyer's decision whether to view an advertised property, or 18 'Product' includes goods and services, including immovable property, rights and obligations. 19 CPRs 2(1).
