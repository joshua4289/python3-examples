Colors
 
Tkinter represents colors with strings. There are 
two general ways to specify colors 
in Tkinter:
 
46.
 
You can use a string specifying the proportion 
of red, green and blue in hexadecimal digits. 
For example, "#fff" is white, "#000000" is 
black, "#000fff000" is pure green, and "#00ffff" 
is pure cyan (green plus
 
blue).
