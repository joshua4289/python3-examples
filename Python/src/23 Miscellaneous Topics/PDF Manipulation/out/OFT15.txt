attention  make known their own particular requirements  in the case of potential buyers, view the property (if this can be done) and take notice of what they can see  make their own enquiries, for example checking out publicly available facts for themselves where this is easy to do. Note, however, that if you tell the average consumer something, they may decide to rely on what you have told them, rather than making their own or any further checks  ask questions about some of the things they do not understand, but generally to trust what representatives of property sales businesses say  instruct other professionals at the appropriate stage of a transaction (for example, surveyors, solicitors or conveyancers).17Generally, there will be limits to how much information the average consumer can take in at one time and they will be influenced by marketing techniques, for example the way prices are presented. They may also tend to trust the particular trader with whom they are dealing.  KEY POINT Å’ Your commercial practices will be judged in relation to the average consumer, not an actual consumer (who may be more or less aware than the average consumer). 17 Note that the point at which the seller or prospective buyer instructs other professionals might vary depending on the type of property sale, for example it would take place at an earlier point for property auctions than general estate agency sales.
