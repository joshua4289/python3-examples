Where staff fail to handle legitimate consumer complaints properly, or place barriers in the way of a client exercising their 
contractual rights, this could be an aggressive practice under the regulations, and thus unlawful. It could also of course give rise to 
complaints under a redress scheme. 5.50 You should have an effective customer complaints procedure that is 
understood and followed by all staff who may come into contact with 
the public. It is good practice to have a written complaints procedure 
that is available to the public. 5.51 Deal with complaints promptly, effectively and in a professional manner. 5.52 Make your best efforts to find a satisfactory solution to any complaints made. Ensure that the steps you take to satisfy the consumer or business customer meet with reasonable expectations. 5.53 Keep a record of all complaints and note the final outcome. 5.54 Cooperate fully with any appropriate representative or intermediary, for example a Trading Standards Service, an ombudsman or a Citizens 
Advice Bureau, consulted by a consumer in respect of a complaint against you.
