List Elements
 
To remove a list element, you can use either the del statement if you 
know exactly 
which element(s) you are deleting or the remove() method if you do not know. Fo
r
 
example:
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
 
list1 
=
 
[
'physics'
,
 
'chemistry'
,
 
1997
,
 
2000
];
 
 
print
 
list1
;
 
del
 
list1
[
2
];
 
print
 
"After deleting value at index 2 :
 
"
 
print
 
list1
;
 
When the above code is executed, it produces following result:
 
[
'physics'
,
 
'chemistry'
,
 
1997
,
 
2000
]
 
After
 
deleting value at index 
2
 
:
 
[
'physics'
,
 
'chemistry'
,
 
2000
]
 
Note:
 
remove() method is discussed in subsequent section.
 
Basic List 
Operations
 
Lists respond to the + and * operators much like strings; they mean concatenation 
and repetition here too, except that the result is a new list, not a string.
 
In fact, lists respond to all of the general sequence operations we used on strings i
n 
the prior chapter.
