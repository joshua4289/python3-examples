or platform through which prospective house buyers and sellers can contact each other. In these circumstances you should make sure that 
the information templates you provide to sellers are comprehensive, so that all information reasonably likely to be relevant to meet the expectations of platform users is captured (thus avoiding a misleading omission). You should also act promptly to investigate and, if necessary 
remove, content you are given to publish, where you become aware that 
it may be in breach of the regulations. Failing to do so may mean you are 
liable under the regulations.  5.25 Paragraphs 5.26 to 5.27 below are aimed more at mainstream property 
sales businesses that inspect a property, market it for sale, arrange 
viewings, communicate offers and negotiate the sale (although elements 
of these paragraphs may be relevant to business models which offer some of these services). 5.26 When you gather the information you need for marketing purposes, take 
reasonable steps to establish its truth and accuracy. The following 
framework may help you:  Assess the property: - In general we would expect property sales businesses to carry 
out an inspection of the property, and to take reasonable steps 
to gather relevant information to provide to prospective 
purchasers. If you decide not to undertake an inspection or you 
only carry out a limited one, you may still be in breach of the 
CPRs if there was material information that you could have discovered and should have disclosed in the marketing of the property, had you carried out an inspection or done a more 
detailed one. 45 CPRs 18.
