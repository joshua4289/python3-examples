Single Statement Suites
 
Similar to the
 
if
 
statement syntax, if your
 
while
 
clause consists only of a single 
statement, it may be placed on the same line as the while header.
 
Here is the syntax and example of a
 
one
-
line while
 
clause:
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
 
flag 
=
 
1
 
 
while
 
(
flag
):
 
print
 
'Given flag is really true!'
 
 
print
 
"Good bye!"
 
It
 
i
s better not try above example because it go
es
 
into infinite loop and you 
need to 
press
 
CTRL+C keys to 
exit
.
 
For Loop
 
It 
has the ability to iterate over 
the items of any sequence, such as a list or a string.
