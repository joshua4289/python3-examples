Child
(

):
 
# define child class

__init__

c 
=
 
Child

# instance of child
 
c
.
childMethod
()
      
# child calls its method
 
c
.
parentMethod
()
     
# calls parent's method
 
c
.
setAttr
(
200
)
       
# again call
 
parent's method
 
c
.
getAttr
()
          
# again call parent's method
 
When the above code is executed, it produces the following result:
 
Calling
 
child constructor
 
Calling
 
child method
 
Calling
 
parent method
 
Parent
 
attribute 
:
 
200
 
Similar way, you can drive a c
lass from multiple parent classes as follows:
 
class
 
A
:
        
# define your class A
 
.....
 
 
class
 
B
:
         
# define your calss B
 
.....
 
 
class
 
C
(
A
,
 
B
):
   
# subclass of A and B
