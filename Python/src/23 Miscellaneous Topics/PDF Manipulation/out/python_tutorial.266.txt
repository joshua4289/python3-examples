This kind of a
 
try
-
except
 
statement catches all the exceptions that occur. Using this 
kind of try
-
except statement is not considered a good programming practice though, 
because it catches all exceptions but does not mak
e the programmer identify the root 
cause of the problem that may occur.

except

You can also use the same
 
except
 
statement to handle multiple exceptions as follows:
 
try
:
 
   
You
 
do
 
your operations here
;
 
   
......................
 
except
(
Exception1
[,
 
Exception2
[,...
ExceptionN
]]]):
 
   
If
 
there 
is
 
any exception 
from
 
the given exception list
,
 
 
   
then
 
execute 
this
 
block
.
 
   
......................
 
else
:
 
   
If
 
there 
is
 
no
 
exception 
then
 
execute 
this
 
block
.
