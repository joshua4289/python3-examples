Each key is separated from its value by a colon (:), the items are separated by 
commas, and the whole thing is enclosed in curly braces. An e
mpty dictionary without 
any items is written with just two curly braces, like this: {}.
 
Keys are unique within a dictionary while values may not be. The values of a 
dictionary can be of any type, but the keys must be of an immutable data type such 
as strin
gs, numbers, or tuples.
 
Accessing Values in Dictionary
 
To access dictionary elements, you can use the familiar square brackets along with 
the key to obtain its value. Following is a simple example:
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
 
dict 
=
 
{
'Name'
:
 
'Zara'
,
 
'Age'
:
 
7
,
 
'Clas
s'
:
 
'First'
};
 
 
print
 
"dict['Name']: "
,
 
dict
[
'Name'
];
 
print
 
"dict['Age']: "
,
 
dict
[
'Age'
];
 
When the above code is executed, it produces the following result:
 
dict
[
'Name'
]:
  
Zara
 
dict
[
'Age'
]:
  
7
 
If we attempt to access a data item with a key, which is not 
part of the dictionary, 
we get an error as follows:
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
 
dict 
=
 
{
'Name'
:
 
'Zara'
,
 
'Age'
:
 
7
,
 
'Class'
:
 
'First'
};
 
 
12.
