length
 
The length of the scale widget. This is the x dimension if the 
scale is hori
zontal, or the y dimension if vertical. The default 
is 100 pixels.
 
orient
 
Set orient=HORIZONTAL if you want the scale to run along 
the x dimension, or orient=VERTICAL to run parallel to the y
-
axis. Default is horizontal.
 
relief
 
Specifies the appearance o
f a decorative border around the 
label. The default is FLAT; for other values.
 
repeatdelay
 
This option controls how long button 1 has to be held down in 
the trough before the slider starts moving in that direction 
repeatedly. Default is repeatdelay=300, a
nd the units are 
milliseconds.
 
resolution
 
Normally, the user will only be able to change the scale in 
whole units. Set this option to some other value to change the 
smallest increment of the scale's value. For example, if 
from_=
-
1.0 and to=1.0, and you se
t resolution=0.5, the scale 
will have 5 possible values: 
-
1.0, 
-
0.5, 0.0, +0.5, and +1.0.
 
showvalue
 
Normally, the current value of the scale is displayed in text 
form by the slider (above it for horizontal scales, to the left 
for vertical scales). Set 
this option to 0 to suppress that label.
 
sliderlength
 
Normally the slider is 30 pixels along the length of the scale. 
You can change that length by setting the sliderlength option 
to your desired length.
 
state
 
Normally, scale widgets respond to mouse eve
nts, and when 
they have the focus, also keyboard events. Set 
state=DISABLED to make the widget unresponsive.
 
takefocus
 
Normally, the focus will cycle through scale widgets. Set this 
option to 0 if you don't want this behavior.
 
tickinterval
 
To display per
iodic scale values, set this option to a number, 
and ticks will be displayed on multiples of that value. For 
example, if from_=0.0, to=1.0, and tickinterval=0.25, labels 
will be displayed along the scale at values 0.0, 0.25, 0.50,
