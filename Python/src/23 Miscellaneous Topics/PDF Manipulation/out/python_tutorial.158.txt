Return Value
 
If elements are of the same type, perform the compare and return the result. If 
elements are different types, check to see if they 
are numbers.
 

 
If numbers, perform numeric coercion if necessary and compare.
 

 
If either element is a number, then the other element is "larger" (numbers are 
"smallest").
 

 
Otherwise, types are sorted alphabetically by name.
 
If we reached the end of one of the 
tuples, the longer tuple is "larger." If we exhaust 
both tuples and share the same data, the result is a tie, meaning that 0 is returned.
 
Example
 
The following example shows the usage of cmp() method.
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
 
tuple1
,
 
tuple2 
=
 
(
123
,
 
'xyz'
),
 
(
456
,
 
'abc'
)
 
 
print
 
cmp
(
tuple1
,
 
tuple2
);
 
print
 
cmp
(
tuple2
,
 
tuple1
);
 
tuple3 
=
 
tuple2 
+
 
(
786
,);
 
print
 
cmp
(
tuple2
,
 
tuple3
)
 
When we run above program, it produces following result:
 
-
1
 
1
 
-
