This method table is a simple array 
of PyMethodDef structures. That structure looks 
something like this:
 
struct
 
PyMethodDef
 
{
 
   
char
 
*
ml_name
;
 
   
PyCFunction
 
ml_meth
;
 
   
int
 
ml_flags
;
 
   
char
 
*
ml_doc
;
 
};
 
Here is the description of the members of this structure:
 
142.
 
ml_name:
 
This is the name of the function as 
the Python interpreter 
present
s
 
when it is 
used in Python programs.
 
143.
 
ml_meth:
 
This must be the address to a 
function that has any one of the signatures 
described in previous seection.
 
144.
 
ml_flags:
 
This tells the inte
rpreter which of the 
three signatures ml_meth is using.
 
o
 
This flag 
usually ha
s
 
a value of METH_VARARGS.
 
o
 
This flag can be bitwise 
OR
'ed with METH_KEYWORDS if you want to 
allow keyword arguments into your function.
 
o
 
This can also have a value of METH_
NOARGS that indicates you do
 
n
o
t 
want to accept any arguments.
 
145.
 
ml_doc:
 
This is the docstring for the function, 
which could be NULL if you do
 
n
o
t feel like 
writing one
.
 
This table needs to be terminated with a sentinel that consists of NULL and 0 values 
for the appropriate members.
 
Example
 
For the above
-
defined function, we 
have following method mapping table:
