Override t
he
 
__init_
(self [,args])
 
method to add additional arguments.
 

 
Then, override the run(self [,args]) method to implement what the thread 
should do when started.
 
Once you have created the new
 
Thread
 
subclass, you can create an instance of it and 
then start a 
new thread by invoking the
 
start()
, which 
in turn call
s
 
run()
 
method.
