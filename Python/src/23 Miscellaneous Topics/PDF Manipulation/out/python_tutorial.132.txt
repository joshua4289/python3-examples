The following exampl
e shows the usage of translate() method. Under this every vowel 
in a string is replaced by its vowel position:
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
 
from
 
string
 
import
 
maketrans   
# Required to call maketrans function.
 
 
intab 
=
 
"aeiou"
 
outtab 
=
 
"12345"
 
trantab 
=
 
maketrans
(
intab
,
 
outtab
)
 
 
str 
=
 
"this is string example....wow!!!"
;
 
print
 
str
.
translate
(
trantab
);
 
When we run above program, it produces following result:
 
th3s

Following is the example to delete 'x' and 'm' characters from the string:
 
#!/
usr/bin/python
 
 
from
 
string
 
import
 
maketrans   
# Required to call maketrans function.
 
 
intab 
=
 
"aeiou"
