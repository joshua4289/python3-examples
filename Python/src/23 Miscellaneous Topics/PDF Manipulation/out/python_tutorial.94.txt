Raw strings do
 
n
o
t treat the backslash as a special character at all. Every character 
you put in
to a raw string stays the way you wrote it:
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
print
 
'C:
\
\
nowhere'
 
When the above code is executed, it produces the following result:
 
C
:
\
nowhere
 
Now let's make use of raw string. We would put expression in
 
r'expression'
 
as 
follows:
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
print
 
r
'C:
\
\
nowhere'
 
When the above code is executed, it produces the following result:
 
C
:
\
\
nowhere
 
Unicode String
 
Normal strings in Python are stored internally as 8
-
bit ASCII, while Unicode strings 
are stored as 16
-
bit Unicode. This all
ows for a more varied set of characters, including 
special characters from most languages in the world. I'll restrict my treatment of 
Unicode strings to the following:
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
print
 
u
'Hello, world!'
 
When the above code is executed, it produces 
the following result:
 
Hello
,
 
world
!
 
As you can see, Unicode strings use the prefix u, just as raw strings use the prefix r.
