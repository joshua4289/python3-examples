Here, key point of the
 
while
 
loop is that the loop might not ever run. When the 
condition is tested and the result is false, t
he loop body will be skipped and the first 
statement after the while loop will be executed.
 
Example
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
 
count 
=
 
0
 
while
 
(
count 
<
 
9
):
 
   
print
 
'The count is:'
,
 
count
 
   
count 
=
 
count 
+
 
1
 
 
print
 
"Good bye!"
 
When the above code is executed, it 
produces the following result:
 
The
 
count 
is
:
 
0
 
The
 
count 
is
:
 
1
 
The
 
count 
is
:
 
2
