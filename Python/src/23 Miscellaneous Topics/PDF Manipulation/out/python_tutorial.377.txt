text is justified: CENTER, LEFT, or RIGHT.
 
offvalue
 
Normally, a checkbutton's associated control variable will be set 
to 0 when it is cleared (off). You can su
pply an alternate value 
for the off state by setting offvalue to that value.
 
onvalue
 
Normally, a checkbutton's associated control variable will be set 
to 1 when it is set (on). You can supply an alternate value for 
the on state by setting onvalue to that 
value.

of the other styles

state
 
The default is state=NORMAL, but you can use 
state=DISABLED to gray out the control and make it 
unresponsive. If the cursor is currently over the checkbutton, 
the state is ACTIVE.
