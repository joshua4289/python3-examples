Line Statements
 
Statements in Python
 
typically end with a new line. Python does, however, allow the 
use of the line continuation character (
\
) to denote that the line should continue. For 
example:
 
total 
=
 
item_one 
+
 
\
 
        
item_two 
+
 
\
 
        
item_three
 
Statements contained within the []
, {}
,
 
or () brackets do not need to use the line 
continuation character. For example:
 
days 
=
 
[
'Monday'
,
 
'Tuesday'
,
 
'Wednesday'
,
 
        
'Thursday'
,
 
'Friday'
]
 
Quotation in Python
 
Python accepts single ('), double (") and triple (''' or """) quotes to denot
e string 
literals, as long as the same type of quote starts and ends the string.
 
The triple quotes 
are 
used to span the string across multiple lines. For example, all 
the following are legal:
 
word 
=
 
'word'
 
sentence 
=
 
"This is a sentence."
 
paragraph 
=
 
"""This is a paragraph. It is
 
made up of multiple lines and sentences."""
 
Comments in Python
 
A hash sign (#) that is not inside a string literal begins a comment. All characters 
after the # and up to the 
end of the 
physical line 
are part of the 
comment and the 
Python interpreter ignores them.
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
 
# First comment
