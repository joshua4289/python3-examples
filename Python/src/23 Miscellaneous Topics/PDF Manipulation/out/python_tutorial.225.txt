file_name:
 
The file_name argument is a string value that contains the name 
of the file that you want to access.
 

 
access_mode:
 
The access_mode determines 
the mode in which the file has 
to be opened, i.e., read, write, append, etc. A complete list of possible values 
is given below in the table. This is optional parameter and the default file 
access mode is read (r).
 

 
buffering:
 
If the buffering value is set t
o 0, no buffering 
take
s
 
place. If the 
buffering value is 1, line buffering 
is 
performed while accessing a file. If you 
specify the buffering value as an integer greater than 1, then buffering action 
is 
performed with the indicated buff
er size. If negative, the buffer size is the 
system default
 
(default behavior).
