assume
 
that you have Python interpreter set in PATH variable. Now, try to run 
this program as follows:
 
$ python test
.
py
 
This 
produce
s
 
the following result:
 
Hello, Python!
 
Let
 
u
s try another way to execute a Python script. 
Here
 
is the modified test.py file:
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
print
 
"Hello, Python!"
;
 
We
 
assume
 
that you have Python interpreter available in /usr/bin directory. Now, try 
to run this program as follows:
 
$ chmod

x test
.
py     
# This is to make file executable
 
$
./

Python Identifiers
 
A Python identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module
,
 
or 
other object. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z or a to z
,
 
or an underscore (_) 
followed by zero or more letters, underscores and digits (0 to 9).
 
Python does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $
,
 
and % within identifiers. 
Python is a case sensitive programming language. 
Thus,
 
Manpower
 
and
 
manpower
 
are 
two different identifiers in Python.
 
Here are 
naming convention
s
 
for Python
 
identifiers
:
 

 
Class names start with an uppercase letter
.
 
A
ll other identifiers 
start 
with a 
lowercase letter.
 

 
Starting an identifier with a single leadin
g underscore indicates 
that the 
identifier is 
private.
