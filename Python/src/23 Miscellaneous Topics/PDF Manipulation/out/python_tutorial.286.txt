A
 
regular expression
 
is a special sequence of characters that helps you match or find 
other strings or sets of strings, using a specialized syntax held in a 
pattern. Regular 
expressions are widely used in UNIX world.
 
The module
 
re
 
provides full support for Perl
-
like regular expressions in Python. The 
re
 
module raises the exception 
re.error
 
if an error occurs while compiling or using a 
regular expression.
 
We wo
uld cover two important functions, which would be used to handle regular 
expressions. But a small thing first: There are various characters, which would have 
special meaning when they are used in regular expression. To avoid any confusion 
while dealing wit
h regular expressions, we would use Raw Strings as
 
r'expression'
.
 
The
 
match
 
Function
 
This function attempts to match RE
 
pattern
 
to
 
string
 
with optional
 
flags
.
 
Here is the syntax for this function:
 
re
.
match
(
pattern
,
 
string
,
 
flags
=
0
)
 
Here is the description 
of the parameters:
 
Parameter
 
Description
 
pattern
 
This is the regular expression to be matched.
 
string
 
This is the string, which would be searched to match the 
pattern at the beginning of string.
 
flags
 
You can specify different flags using bitwise OR 
(|). These 
are modifiers, which are listed in the table below.
 
The
 
re.match
 
function returns a
 
match
 
object on success,
 
none
 
on failure. We 
use
group(num)
 
or
 
groups()
 
function of
 
match
 
object to get matched expression.
