Sending an HTML e
-
mail using Python
 
When you send a text message using Python, then all the content 
are
 
treated as 
simple text. Even if you 
include HTML tags in a text messag
e, it 
is
 
displayed as simple 
text and HTML tags will not be formatted according to HTML syntax. But Python 
provides option to send an HTML message as actual HTML message.
 
While sending an e
-
mail message, you can specify a Mime version, content type
,
 
and 
character set to send an HTML e
-
mail.
 
Example
 
Following is the example to send HTML content as an e
-
mail. Try it once:
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
 
import smtplib
 
 
message = """From: From Person <from@fromdomain.com>
 
To: To Person <to@todomain.com>
 
MIME
-
Version: 1.0
 
Content
-
type: text/html
 
Subject: SMTP HTML e
-

This is an e
-
mail message to be sent in HTML format
 
 
<b>This is HTML message.</b>
 
<h1>This is headline.</h1>
 
"""
 
 
try:
 
   
smtpObj = smtplib.SMTP('localhost')
 
   
smtpObj.sendmail(send
er, receivers, message)
