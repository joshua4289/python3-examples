A Simple Client
 
Let us
 
write a very simple client program which 
open
s
 
a connection to a given port 
12345 and given host. This is 
very simple to create a socket client using 
Python's
 
socket
module function.
 
The
 
socket.connect(hosname, port )
 
opens a TCP connection to
 
hostname
 
on 
the
 
port
. Once you have a socket open, you can read from it like any IO object. When 
done, remember to clos
e it, as you would close a file.
 
The following code is a very simple client that connects to a given host and port, 
reads any available data from the socket, and then exits:
 
#!/usr/bin/python           # This is client.py file
 
 
import socket               
# Import socket module
 
 
s = socket.socket()         # Create a socket object
 
host = socket.gethostname() # Get local machine name
 
port = 12345                # Reserve a port for your service.
