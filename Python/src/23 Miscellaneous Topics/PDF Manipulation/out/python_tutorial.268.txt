When an exception is thrown in the
 
try
 
block, the execution immediately pass
es to 
the
 
finally
 
block. After all the statements in the 
finally
 
block are executed, the 
exception is raised again and is handled in the
 
except
 
statements if present in the 
next higher layer of the
 
try
-
except
 
statement.
 
Argument of an Exception
 
An excepti

argument
, which is a value that gives additional information 
about the problem. The contents of the argument vary by exception. You

try
:

do
 
your operations here
;
 
   
......................
 
except
 
ExceptionType
,
 
Argument
:
 
   
You
 
can 
print
 
value of 
Argument
 
here
...
 
If you 
writ

the code to handle a single exception, you can have a variable follow the 
name of the exception in the except st
atement. If you are trapping multiple 
exceptions, you can have a variable follow the tuple of the exception.
 
This variable 
receive
s
 
the value of the exception mostly containing the cause of the 
exception. The variable can receive a single value or multiple values in the form of a
