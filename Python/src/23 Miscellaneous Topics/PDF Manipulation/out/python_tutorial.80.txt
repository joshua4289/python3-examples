Continue Statement
 
It
 
returns the control to the beginning of the while loop. The
 
continue
 
statement 
rejects 
all the remaining statements in the current iteration of the loop and moves 
the control back to the top of the loop.
 
The
 
continue
 
statement can be used in both
 
while
 
and
 
for
 
loops.
