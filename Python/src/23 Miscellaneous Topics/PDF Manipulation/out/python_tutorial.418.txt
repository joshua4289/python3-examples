This option specifies how much extra vertical space to add 
between displayed lines of text when a logical line wraps. 
Default is 0.
 
spacing3
 
This option specifies how much extra vertical space is added 
below each line of text. If a line wraps, this space is added 
only after the last line it occupies on the display. Default is 0.
 
state
 
Normally, text widgets respond to keyboard and 
mouse 
events; set state=NORMAL to get this behavior. If you set 
state=DISABLED, the text widget will not respond, and you 
won't be able to modify its contents programmatically either.
 
tabs
 
This option controls how tab characters position text.
 
width
 
The 
width of the widget in characters (not pixels!), measured 
according to the current font size.
 
wrap
 
This option controls the display of lines that are too wide. Set 
wrap=WORD and it will break the line after the last word that 
will fit. With the default be
havior, wrap=CHAR, any line that 
gets too long will be broken at any character.
 
xscrollcommand
 
To make the text widget horizontally scrollable, set this option 
to the set() method of the horizontal scrollbar.
 
yscrollcommand
 
To make the text widget 
vertically scrollable, set this option 
to the set() method of the vertical scrollbar.
