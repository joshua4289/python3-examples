(a)
 
More than one entry per key not allowed. Which means no duplicate key is 
allowed. When duplicate keys encountered during assignment, the la
st assignment 
wins. Fo
r
 
example:
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
 
dict 
=
 
{
'Name'
:
 
'Zara'
,
 
'Age'
:
 
7
,
 
'Name'
:
 
'Manni'
};
 
 
print
 
"dict['Name']: "
,
 
dict
[
'Name'
];
 
When the above code is executed, it produces the following result:
 
dict
[
'Name'
]:
  
Manni
 
(b)
 
Keys must be immutable. Which means you can use strings, numbers or tuples 
as dictionary keys but something like ['key'] is not allowed. Following is a simple 
example:
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
 
dict 
=
 
{[
'Name'
]:
 
'Zara'
,
 
'Age'
:
 
7
};
 
 
print
 
"dict['Name']: "
,
 
dict
[
'N
ame'
];
 
When the above code is executed, it produces the following result:
