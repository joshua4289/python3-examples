Any code that you write using any 
compiled language like C, C++
,
 
or Java can be 
integrated or imported into another Python script. This code is considered as an 
"extension."
 
A Python extension module is nothing more than a normal C library. On Unix 
machines, these libraries usually end in
 
.so
 
(for shared object). On Windows 
machines, you typically see
 
.dll
 
(for dynamically linked library).

Requisite
s
 
for Writing Extensions
 
To start writing your extension, you are going to need the Python header files.

On Unix machines, this usually req
uires 
installing a developer
-
specific package such 
as
 
python2.5
-
dev
.
 
137.
 
Windows users get these headers as part of 
the package when they use the binary Python 
installer.
 
Additionally, it is assumed that you have good knowledge of C or C++ to write any 
Python Extension using C programming.

For your first look at a Python extension module, you
 
need to
 
group
 
your code into 
four pa
rt
:
 
138.
 
The header file
 
Python.h
.
 
139.
 
The C functions you want to expose as the 
interface from your module.
 
140.
 
A table mapping the names of your functions 
as Python developers 
see them to C functions 
inside the extension module.
 
141.
 
An initialization function.
