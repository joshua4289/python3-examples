Python SAX

Parsing XML with DOM APIs
 
The Document 
Object Model
 
(
DOM
)
 
is a cross
-
language API from the World Wide Web 
Consortium (W3C) for accessing and modifying XML documents.
 
The DOM is extremely useful for random
-
access applications. SAX only allows you a 
view of one bit of the document at a ti
me. If you are looking at one SAX element, 
you have no access to another.
 
Here is the easiest way to quickly load an XML document and to create a minidom 
object using the xml.dom module. The minidom object provides a simple parser 
method that 
quickly 
create
s
 
a DOM tree from the XML file.
 
The sample phrase calls the parse( file [,parser] ) function of the minidom object to 
parse the XML file designated by file into a DOM tree object.
