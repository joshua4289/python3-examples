Matching 
Versu
s Searching
 
Python offers two different primitive operations based on regular expressions:
 
match
 
checks for a match only at the beginning of the string, while
 
search
 
checks for a 
match anywhere in the 
string (this is what Perl does by default).
 
Example
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
import
 
re
 
 
line 
=
 
"Cats are smarter than dogs"
;
 
 
matchObj 
=
 
re

,

print
 
"match
