2.9 To satisfy your obligations under the CPRs and BPRs, you need to treat consumers, business customers and competitors fairly. It will help if you can show that you act diligently, in keeping with any professional 
standards and taking reasonable steps to avoid committing a breach 
[p41-56]. For example  You take care in gathering and presenting the information that you will use to advertise your services and market property.  You have systems and safeguards in place to ensure that your marketing information is accurate, balanced and does not leave out material facts.  When you see or hear something that puts you on notice that there might be a problem, you take reasonable steps to establish the facts 
for yourself. For example, you ask questions, carry out your own 
checks and/or consult official sources, as necessary.  You act promptly to correct or update your marketing and to pass on information whenever new information becomes available.  Where you have exhausted the steps that you can reasonably be 
expected to take, you are open about any remaining gaps in your knowledge.
