min(list)
 
Returns item from the list with min value.
 
5
 
list(seq)
 
Converts a tuple into list.
 
 
Let us go through the
 
functions
 
in detail:
 
Cmp(list1, list2)
 
Description
 
The method
 
cmp()
 
compares elements of two lists.
 
Syntax
 
Following is the syntax for
 
cmp()
 
method:
 
cmp
(
list1
,
 
list2
)
 
Parameters
 

 
list1
 
--
 
This is the first list to be compared.
 

 
list2
 
--
 
This is the second list to be compared.
 
Return Value
 
If elements are of the same type, perform the compare and return the result. If 
elements are different types,
 
check to see if they are numbers.
 

 
If numbers, perform numeric coercion if necessary and compare.
 

 
If either element is a number, then the other element is "larger" (numbers are 
"smallest").
 

 
Otherwise, types are sorted alphabetically by name.
 
If we reached 
the end of one of the lists, the longer list is "larger." If we exhaust both 
lists and share the same data, the result is a tie, meaning that 0 is returned.
