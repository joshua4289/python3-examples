The Python language has many similarities to Perl, C
,
 
and Java. However, there are 
some definite differences between the languages. 
 
First Python Program
 
Let us execute programs in different modes of programming.
 
Interactive Mode Programming:
 
Invoking the interpreter without passing a script file as a parameter brings 
up the 
following prompt:
 
$ python

Type

"copyright"

>>>
 
Type the following text 
at
 
the Python prompt and press the Enter
:
 
>>>
 
print
 
"Hello, Python!"
;
 
If you are running new version of Python, then you 
need to use print statement with 
parenthesis 
as in
 
print ("Hello, Python!");
. However 
in
 
Python version 2.4.3, this 
produce
s the
 
following result:
 
Hello
,
 
Python
!
 
Script Mode Programming
 
Invoking the interpreter with a script parameter begins execution of the script and 
continues until the script is finished. When the script is finished, the interpreter is no 
longer act
ive.
 
Let us write a simple Python program in a script. 
P
ython files 
have extension
 
.py
. 
Type 
the following source code in a test.py file
:
 
print
 
"Hello, Python!"
