Packages in Python
 
A package is a hierarchical file directory 
structure that defines a single Python 
application environment that consists of modules and subpackages and sub
-
subpackages, and so on.
 
Consider a file
 
Pots.py
 
available in
 
Phone
 
directory. This file has following line of 
source code:
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
 
def
 
Pots
():
 
   
print
 
"I'm Pots Phone"
 
Similar way, we have another two files having different functions with the same name 
as above:
 

 
Phone/Isdn.py
 
file having function Isdn()
 

 
Phone/G3.py
 
file having 
function G3()
 
Now, create one more file __init__.py in
 
Phone
 
directory:
 

 
Phone/__init__.py
 
To make all of your functions available when you've imported Phone, you need to put 
explicit import statements in __init__.py as follows:
 
from
 
Pots
 
import
 
Pots
 
from
 
Isdn
 
import
 
Isdn
 
from
 
G3 
import
 
G3
 
After you
 
add
 
th
ese lines to __init__.py, you have all of these classes available when 
you
 
import
 
the Phone package.
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
 
# Now import your Phone Package.
 
import
 
Phone
