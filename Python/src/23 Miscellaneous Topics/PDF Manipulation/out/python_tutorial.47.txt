Python Assignment Operators
 
Assume variable a holds 10 and variable b holds 20, then:
 
 
Operator
 
Description
 
Example
 
=
 
Assigns values from right side operands to 
left side operand
 
c = a + b 
assign
s
 
value of a + b into c
 
+=
 
 
Add AND
 
It adds right operand to the left operand 
and assign the result to left operand
 
c += a is equivalent 
to c = c + a
