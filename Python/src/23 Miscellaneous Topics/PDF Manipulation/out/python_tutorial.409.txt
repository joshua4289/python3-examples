the widget that are 
outside the trough.
 
bd
 
Width of the 3

command
 
A procedure to be called every time the slider is moved. This 
procedure will be passed one argument, the new scale value. 
If the
 
slider is moved rapidly, you may not get a callback for 
every possible position, but you'll certainly get a callback 
when it settles.
 
cursor

arrow, dot etc.
), the 
mouse cursor will change to that pattern when it i
s over the 
scale.
 
digits
 
The way your program reads the current value shown in a 
scale widget is through a control variable. The control variable 
for a scale can be an IntVar, a DoubleVar (float), or a 
StringVar. If it is a string variable, the digits opt
ion controls 
how many digits to use when the numeric scale value is 
converted to a string.
 
font
 
The font used for the label and annotations.
 
fg
 
The color of the text used for the label and annotations.
 
from_
 
A float or integer value that defines one end
 
of the scale's 
range.
 
highlightbackground
 
The color of the focus highlight when the scale does not have 
focus.
 
highlightcolor
 
The color of the focus highlight when the scale has the focus.
 
label
 
You can display a label within the scale widget by 
setting this 
option to the label's text. The label appears in the top left 
corner if the scale is horizontal, or the top right corner if 
vertical. The default is no label.
