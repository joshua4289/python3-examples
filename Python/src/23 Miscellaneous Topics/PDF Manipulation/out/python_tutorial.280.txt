Class Inheritance
 
Instead of starting from scratch, you can create a class by
 
deriving it from a 
preexisting class by listing the parent class in parentheses after the new class name.
 
The child class inherits the attributes of its parent class, and you can use those 
attributes as if they were defined in the child class. A child cla
ss can also override 
data members and methods from the parent.
 
Syntax
 
Derived classes are declared much like their parent class; however, a list of base 
classes to inherit from 
is
 
given after the class name:
 
class
 
SubClassName
 
(
ParentClass1
[,
 
ParentClass2
,
 
...]):
 
   
'Optional class documentation string'
 
   
class_suite
 
Example
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
 
class
 
Parent
:
        
# define parent class
 
   
parentAttr 
=
 
100
 
   
def
 
__init__
(
self
):
 
      
print
 
"Calling parent constructor"
 
 
   
def
 
parentMethod
(
sel
f
):
 
      
print
 
'Calling parent method'
 
 
   
def
 
setAttr
(
self
,
 
attr
):
 
      
Parent
.
parentAttr 
=
