# Fetch all the rows in a list of lists.
 
   
results = cursor.fetchall()
 
   
for row in results:
 
      
fname = row[0]
 
      
lname = row[1]
 
      
age = row[2]
 
      
sex = row[3]
 
      
income = row[4]
 
      
# Now print fetched result
 
      
print "fname=%s,lname=%s,age=%d,sex=%s,income=%d" % 
\
 
             
(fname, lname, age, sex, income )
 
except:
 
   
print "Error: unable to fecth data"
 
 
# disconnect from server
 
db
.close()
 
This will produce the following result:
 
fname=Mac, lname=Mohan, age=20, sex=M, income=2000
