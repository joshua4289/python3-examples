method
 
__del__()
, called a destructor, that is invoked when the instance i
s about to 
be destroyed. This method might be used to clean up any non
-
memory resources 
used by an instance.
 
Example
 
This __del__() destructor prints the class name of an instance that is about to be 
destroyed:
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
 
class
 
Point
:
 
   
def
 
__init
(
 
self
,
 
x
=
0
,
 
y
=
0
):
 
      
self
.
x 
=
 
x
 
      
self
.
y 
=
 
y
 
   
def
 
__del__
(
self
):
 
      
class_name 
=
 
self
.
__class__
.
__name__
 
      
print
 
class_name
,
 
"destroyed"
 
 
pt1 
=
 
Point
()
 
pt2 
=
 
pt1
 
pt3 
=
 
pt1
 
print
 
id
(
pt1
),
 
id
(
pt2
),
 
id
(
pt3
)
 
# prints the ids of the 
obejcts
 
del
 
pt1
 
del
 
pt2
 
del
 
pt3
 
When the above code is executed, it produces following result:
 
3083401324
 
3083401324
 
3083401324
 
Point
 
destroyed
 
Note:
 
Ideally, you should define your classes in separate file, then you should import 
them in your main program
 
file using
 
import
 
statement.
