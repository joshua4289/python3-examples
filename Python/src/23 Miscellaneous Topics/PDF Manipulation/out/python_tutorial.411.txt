to
 
A float or integer value that defines one end of the scale's 
range; the other end is defined by the from_ option, discussed 
above. The 
to value can be either greater than or less than 
the from_ value. For vertical scales, the to value defines the 
bottom of the scale; for horizontal scales, the right end.
