A tuple is a sequence of immutable Python objects. Tuples are sequences, just like 
lists. The 
difference
s
 
between tuples and lists are, 
the 
tuples can
no
t be changed 
unlike lists 
and tuples use parentheses
, whereas 
 
lists use square brackets.
 
Creating a tuple is as simple as putting different comma
-
separated values
.
 
O
ptionally 
you can put these comma
-
separated values between parentheses also. For example:
 
tup1 
=
 
(
'physics'
,
 
'chemistry'
,
 
1997
,
 
2000
);
 
tup2 
=
 
(
1
,
 
2
,
 
3
,
 
4
,
 
5
 
);
 
tup3 
=
 
"a"
,
 
"b"
,
 
"c"
,
 
"d"
;
 
The empty tuple is written as two parentheses containing nothing:
 
tup1 
=
 
();
 
To write a tuple containing a single value you have to include a comma, even though 
there is only one value:
 
tup1 
=
 
(
50
,);
 
Like string indices, tuple indices start at 0, and 
they
 
can be sliced, concatenated
,
 
and 
so on.
 
Accessing Values in Tuples
 
To access values in tuple, use the square brackets for slicing along with the index or 
indices to obtain value available at th
at index. Fo
r
 
example:
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
 
tup1 
=
 
(
'physics'
,
 
'chemistry'
,
 
1997
,
 
2000
);
 
tup2 
=
 
(
1
,
 
2
,
 
3
,
 
4
,
 
5
,
 
6
,
 
7
 
);
 
 
print
 
"tup1[0]: "
,
 
tup1
