A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, 
related action. Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high 
degree of code reusing.
 
As you already know, Python gives y
ou many built
-
in functions 
such as
 
print()
 
and
 
but you can also create your own functions. These functions are called
 
user
-
defined 
functions.
 
Defining a Function
 
You can define functions to provide the required functionality. Here are simple rules 
to 
define a function in Python.
 

 
Function blocks begin with the keyword
 
def
 
followed by the function name and 
parentheses ( ( ) ).
 

 
Any inpu
t parameters or arguments should be placed within these 
parentheses. You can also define parameters inside these parenthe
ses.
 

 
The first statement of a function can be an optional statement 
-
 
the 
documentation string of the function or
 
docstring.
 

 
The code b
lock within every function starts with a colon (:) and is indented.
 

 
The statement return [expression] exits a function, o
ptionally passing back an 
expression to the caller. A return statement with no arguments is the same as 
return None.
 
Syntax
 
def
 
functionname
(
 
parameters 
):
 
   
"function_docstring"
 
   
function_suite
 
   
return
 
[
expression
]
 
By default, parameters have a 
positional behavior and you need to inform them in 
the same order that they were defined.
