To translate a time instant from a
 
seconds since the epoch
 
floating
-
point value into a 
time
-
tuple, pass the floating
-
point value
 
to a function (
For example
, localtime) that 
returns a time
-
tuple with all nine items valid.
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
import
 
time
;
 
 
localtime 
=
 
time
.
localtime
(
time
.
time
())
 
print
 
"Local current time :"
,
 
localtime
 
This would produce the following result, which 
could be formatted in any other 
presentable form:
 
Local
 
current time 
:

You can format any time as per 
your requirement, but simple method to get time in 
readable format is asctime():
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
import
 
time
;
 
 
localtime 
=
 
time
.
asctime
(
 
time
.
localtime
(
time
.
time
())
 
)
