Directories in Python
 
All files are contained within various directories, and Python has no problem 
handling 
these too. The
 
os
 
module has several methods that help you create, remove
,
 
and 
change directories.
 
The
 
mkdir()
 
Method
 
You can use the
 
mkdir()
 
method of the
 
os
 
module to create directories in the current 
directory. You need to supply an argument t
o this method which contains the name 
of the directory to be created.
 
Syntax
 
os.mkdir("newdir")
 
Example
 
Following is the example to create a directory
 
test
 
in the current directory:
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
import os
 
 
# Create a directory "test"
 
os.mkdir("test")
