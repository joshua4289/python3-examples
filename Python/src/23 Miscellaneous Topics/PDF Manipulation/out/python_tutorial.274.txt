The variable
 
empCount
 
is a class variable whose value 
is
 
shared among all 
instances of a this class. This can be accessed as
 
Employee.empCount
 
from 
inside the class or outside the class.
 

 
The first method
 
__init__()
 
is a special method, which is called class 
constructor 
or initialization method that Python calls when you create a new 
instance of this class.
 

 
You declare other class methods like normal functions with the exception that 
the first argument to each method is
 
self. Python adds the
 
self
 
argument to 
the list for 
you; you do
 
n
o
t need to include it when you call the methods.

O
bjects
 
To create instances of a class, you call the class using class name and pass in 
whatever arguments its
 
__init__
 
method accepts.
 
"This would create first object of

emp1 
=
 
Employee
(

)
 
"This would create second object of Employee class"
 
emp2 
=
 
Employee
(
"Manni"
,
 
5000
)
