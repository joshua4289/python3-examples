A module is loaded only once, regardless of the number of times it is imported. This 
prevents the module execution from happening over and over again if multiple 
imports occur.
 
The
 
from...import
 
Statement
 
Python's
 
from
 
statement lets you import specific attributes from a module into the 
current namespace. The
 
from...import
 
has the following syntax:
 
from
 
modname 
import
 
name1
[,
 
name2
[,
 
...
 
nameN
]]
 
For example, to import the function 
fibonacci
 
from the module 
fib
, use the following 
statement:
 
from
 
fib 
import
 
fibonacci
 
This statement does not import the entire module fib into the current namespace; it 
just introduces the item 
fibonacci
 
from the module fib into the global symbol table of
 
the importing module.
 
The
 
from...import *
 
Statement:
 
It is also possible to import all names from a module into the current namespace by 
using the following import statement:
 
from
 
modname 
import
 
*
 
This provides an easy way to import all the items from a m
odule into the current 
namespace; however, this statement should be used sparingly.
 
Locating Modules:
 
When you import a module, the Python interpreter searches for the module in the 
following sequences:
 

 
The current directory.
