A generally more reliable method of passing information to a CGI program is the 
POST method. This packages the information in exactly the same way as GET 
methods, but instead of sending it as a text string after a ?
 
in the URL it sends it as 
a separate message. This message comes into the CGI script in the form of the 
standard input.
 
Below is same hello_get.py script which handles GET as well as POST method.

# Get data from fields

getvalue

'first_name'
)
 
last_name
