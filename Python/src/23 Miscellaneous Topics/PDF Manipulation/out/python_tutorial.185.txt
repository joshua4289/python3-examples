Function with Description
 
1
 
time.altzone
 
The offset of the local DST timezone, in seconds west of UTC, if one is 
defined. This is negative if the local DST timezone is east of UTC (as 
in Western Europe, including the UK). 
Only use this if daylight is 
nonzero.
 
2
 
time.asctime([tupletime])
 
Accepts a time
-
tuple and returns a readable 24
-
character string such 
as 'Tue Dec 11 18:07:14 2008'.
 
3
 
time.clock( )
 
Returns the current CPU time as a floating
-
point number of seconds. 
To measure computational costs of different approaches, the value of 
time.clock is more useful than that of time.time().
 
4
 
time.ctime([secs])
 
Like asctime(localtime(secs)) and without arguments is like asctime( 
)
 
5
 
time.gmtime([secs])
 
Accepts an instant expressed 
in seconds since the epoch and returns 
a time
-
tuple t with the UTC time. Note : t.tm_isdst is always 0
 
6
 
time.localtime([secs])
 
Accepts an instant expressed in seconds since the epoch and returns 
a time
-
tuple t with the local time (t.tm_isdst is 0 or 1, depending on 
whether DST applies to instant secs by local rules).
 
7
 
time.mktime(tupletime)
 
Accepts an instant expressed as a time
-
tuple in lo
cal time and returns 
a floating
-
point value with the instant expressed in seconds since the 
epoch.
 
8
 
time.sleep(secs)
 
Suspends the calling thread for secs seconds.
