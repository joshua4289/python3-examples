Triple Quotes
 
Python's triple quotes comes to the rescue by allowing strings to span multiple lines, 
including
 
verbatim NEWLINEs, TABs, and any other special characters.
 
The syntax for triple quotes consists of three consecutive
 
single or double
 
quotes.
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
 
para_str 
=
 
"""this is a long string that is made up of
 
several lines and non
-
printable 
characters such as
 
TAB ( 
\
t ) and they will show up that way when displayed.
 
NEWLINEs within the string, whether explicitly given like
 
this within the brackets [ 
\
n ], or just a NEWLINE within
 
the variable assignment will also show up.
 
"""
 
print
 
para_str
;
 
When the above code is executed, it produces the following result. Note how every 
single special character has been converted to its printed form, right down to the last 
NEWLINE at the end of the string between the "up." and closing triple quotes. Also 
not
e that NEWLINEs occur either with an explicit carriage return at the end of a line 
or its escape code (
\
n):
 
this
 
is
 
a 
long
 
string
 
that 
is
 
made up of
 
several lines 
and
 
non
-
printable characters such 
as
 
TAB 
(
    
)
 
and
 
they will show up that way 
when
 
displayed
.
 
NEWLINEs
 
within the 
string
,
 
whether explicitly given like
 
this
 
within the brackets 
[
 
 
],
 
or
 
just a NEWLINE within
