The
 
pass
 
statement is a
 
null
 
operation; nothing happens when it executes. 
The
 
pass
 
is also useful in places where your code will eventually go, but has 
not been 
written yet (e.g., in stubs for example):
 
Syntax
 
pass
 
Example
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
 
for
 
letter 
in
 
'Python'
:
 
 
   
if
 
letter 
==
 
'h'
:
 
      
pass
 
      
print
 
'This is pass block'
 
   
print
 
'Current Letter :'
,
 
letter
 
 
print
 
"Good bye!"
 
When the above code 
is executed, it produces following result:
 
Current
 
Letter
 
:
 
P
 
Current
 
Letter
 
:
 
y
 
Current
 
Letter
 
:
 
t
 
This
 
is
 
pass
 
block
 
Current
 
Letter
 
:
 
h
 
Current
 
Letter
 
:
 
o
 
Current
 
Letter
 
:
 
n
 
Good
 
bye
