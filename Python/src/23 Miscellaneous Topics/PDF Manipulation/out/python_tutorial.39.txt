The 
f
ollowing 
code 
is invalid with tuple, because we attempted to update a tuple, 
which is not allowed. Similar case is possible with lists:
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
 
tuple 
=
 
(
 
'abcd'
,
 
786
 
,
 
2.23
,
 
'john'
,
 
70.2
  
)
 
list 
=
 
[
 
'abcd'
,
 
786
 
,
 
2.23
,
 
'john'
,
 
70.2
  
]
 
tuple
[
2
]
 
=
 
1000
    
# Invalid syntax with tuple
 
list
[
2
]
 
=
 
1000
     
# Valid syntax with list
 
Python Dictionary
 
Python's dictionaries are kind of hash table type. They work like associative arrays
 
or hashes found in Perl and consist of key
-
value pairs. A dictionary key can be almost 
any Python type, but are usually numbers or strings. Values, on the other hand, can 
be any arbitrary Python object.
 
Dictionaries are enclosed by curly braces (
{ }
) an
d values can be assigned and 
accessed using square braces (
[]
). For example:
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
 
dict 
=
 
{}
 
dict
[
'one'
]
 
=
 
"This is one"
 
dict
[
2
]
     
=
 
"This is two"
 
tinydict 
=
 
{
'name'
:
 
'john'
,
'code'
:
6734
,
 
'dept'
:
 
'sales'
}
 
print
 
dict
[
'one'
]
       
# Prints 
value for 'one' key
 
print
 
dict
[
2
]
           
# Prints value for 2 key
 
print
 
tinydict          
# Prints complete dictionary
 
print
 
tinydict
.
keys
