pass statement
 
The pass statement in Python is used when a statement is 
required syntactically but you do not want any command or 
code to execute.
 
 
Let us go through the loop control 
statements briefly:
 
Break Statement
 
It
 
terminates the current loop and resumes execution at the next statement, just like 
the traditional break 
statement 
in C.
 
The most common use for break is when some external condition is triggered 
requiring a hasty exi
t from a loop. The
 
break
 
statement can be used in 
both
 
while
 
and
 
for
 
loops.
 
If you are using nested loops
, the break statement stop
s
 
the execution of the 
innermost loop and start executing the next line of code after the block.
 
Syntax
 
The syntax for a
 
break
 
statement in Python is as follows:
