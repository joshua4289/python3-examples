object comprises both data members (class variables and instance
 
variables) 
and methods.
 

 
Operator overloading:
 
The assignment of more than one function to a 
particular operator.
 
Creating Classes
 
The
 
class
 
statement creates a new class definition. The name of the class immediately 
follows the keyword
 
class
 
followed by 
a colon as follows:
 
class
 
ClassName
:
 
   
'Optional class documentation string'
 
   
class_suite
 

 
The class has a documentation string, which can be accessed 
via
ClassName.__doc__
.
 

 
The
 
class_suite
 
consists of all the component statements defining class 
members, 
data attributes and functions.
