Once our database connection is established, 
you
 
are ready to make a query into this 
database. 
You
 
can use either
 
fetchone()
 
method to fetch single record 
or
 
fetchall()
 
method to fet
ch multiple values from a database table.
 

 
fetchone():
 
It
 
fetches the next row of a query result set. A result set is an 
object that is returned when a cursor ob
ject is used to query a table.
 

 
fetchall():
 
It
 
fetches all the rows in a result set. If some rows have already 
been extracted from the result set, the
n
 
it
 
retrieves the remaining rows from 
the result set.
 

 
rowcount:
 
This is a read
-
only attribute and returns the number of rows that 
were affected by an execute() method.
 
Example
 
The 
f
ollowing 
procedure 
quer
ries
 
all the records from EMPLOYEE table having salary 
more than 1000:
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
 
import MySQLdb
 
 
# Open data
base connection
 
db = MySQLdb.connect("localhost","testuser","test123","TESTDB" )
 
 
# prepare a cursor object using cursor() method
 
cursor = db.cursor()
 
 
# Prepare SQL query to INSERT a record into the database.
 
sql = "SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE 
\
 
       
WHERE I
NCOME > '%d'" % (1000)
 
try:
 
   
# Execute the SQL command
 
   
cursor.execute(sql)
