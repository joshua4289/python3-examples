Comparison operators
 
<> == !=

= %= /= //= 
-
= += 
*= **=
 
Assignment operators
 
is is not
 
Identity operators

Membership operators

Logical operators
 
Operator precedence affects how an expression is evaluated. 
 
For example, x = 7 + 3 * 2; here, x is assigned 13, not 20 because operator * has 
higher precedence than +, so it first multiplies 3*2 and then adds into 7.
