Option Flags
 
Regular expression literals may include an optional modifier to control various aspects 
of matching. The modifiers are specified as an optional flag. You can provide multiple 
modifiers using exclusive OR (|), a
s shown previously and may be represented by 
one of these:
 
Modifier
 
Description
 
re.I
 
Performs case
-
insensitive matching.
 
re.L
 
Interprets words according to the current locale. This interpretation 
affects the alphabetic group (
\
w and 
\
W), as well as word 
boundary 
behavior (
\
b and 
\
B).
 
re.M
 
Makes $ match the end of a line (not just the end of the string) and 
makes ^ match the start of any line (not just the start of the string).
 
re.S
 
Makes a period (dot) match any character, including a newline.
 
re.U
 
Int
erprets letters according to the Unicode character set. This flag 
affects the behavior of 
\
w, 
\
W, 
\
b, 
\
B.
 
re.X
 
Permits "cuter" regular expression syntax. It ignores whitespace 
(except inside a set [] or when escaped by a backslash) and treats 
unescaped # 
as a comment marker.
