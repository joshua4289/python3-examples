Syntax
 
Here is simple syntax of
 
try....except...else
 
blocks:
 
try
:
 
   
You
 
do
 
your operations here
;
 
   
..........
............
 
except
 
ExceptionI
:
 
   
If
 
there 
is
 
ExceptionI
,
 
then
 
execute 
this
 
block
.
 
except
 
ExceptionII
:
 
   
If
 
there 
is
 
ExceptionII
,
 
then
 
execute 
this
 
block
.
 
   
......................
 
else
:
 
   
If
 
there 
is
 
no
 
exception 
then
 
execute 
this
 
block
.
 
 
Here are few 
important points about the above
-
mentioned syntax:
 

 
A single try statement can have multiple except statements. This is useful 
when the try block contains statements that may throw different types of 
exceptions.
 

 
You can also provide a generic except clause,
 
which handles any exception.
 

 
After the except clause(s), you can include an else
-
clause. The code in the 
else
-
block executes if the code in the try: block does not raise an exception.
 

 
The else
-
block is a good place for code that does not need the try: blo
ck's 
protection.
 
Example
 
This
 
example
 
opens a file
,
 
writes 
content in the
,
 
file and comes out gracefully because 
there is no problem at all:
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
 
try
:
 
   
fh 
=
 
open
(
"testfile"
,
 
"w"
)
