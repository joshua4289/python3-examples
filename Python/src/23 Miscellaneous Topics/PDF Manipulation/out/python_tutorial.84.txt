Python allows you to use a lowercase L with long, but it is recommended that 
you use only an uppercase L to avoid confusion with the number
 
1. Python 
displays long integers with an uppercase L.
 

 
A complex number consists of an ordered pair of real floating
 
point numbers 
denoted by a + bj, where a is the real part and b is the imaginary part of the 
complex number.
 
Number Type Conversion
 
Python 
converts numbers internally in an expression containing mixed types to a 
common type for evaluation. But sometimes, you need to coerce a number explicitly 
from one type to another to satisfy the requirements of an operator or function 
parameter.
 

 
Type
 
int(x
)
 
to convert x to a plain integer.
 

 
Type
 
long(x)
 
to convert x to a long integer.
 

 
Type
 
float(x)
 
to convert x to a floating
-
point number.
 

 
Type
 
complex(x)
 
to convert x to a complex number with real part x and 
imaginary part zero.
