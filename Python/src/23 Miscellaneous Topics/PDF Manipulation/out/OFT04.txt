Collectively, we refer to all such businesses in this guidance as 'property sales businesses'.3 All references to 'you' in this guidance mean property sales businesses.41.4 The regulations apply to the full spectrum of property sales businesses, from traditional high street estate agents that provide a wide range of 
services to businesses that provide a limited service such as introducing potential buyers and sellers or enabling them to exchange contact 
details. The standards expected to comply with the regulations will depend on the circumstances, including the level of service a business provides. This guidance and the examples used should be read with that 
in mind.  1.5 The guidance is also intended to be of use to enforcers and consumer advisors, to help them understand what trading practices are likely to be prohibited. What does the guidance cover? 1.6 The guidance provides an overview of the regulations and sets out some 
examples of the kinds of unfair trading practices or conduct specific to property sales that may breach them. It also sets out some of the practical steps you may wish to take to help you comply with the law. 1.7 Not all points listed will apply to every property sales business (since the range of services they offer may differ). Nor is the guidance intended to 
be exhaustive: it does not cover every situation or practice in which a breach of the CPRs or BPRs may occur. The examples used focus mainly on more mainstream property sales businesses. 1.8 This guidance is not a substitute for the law itself nor does it replace the 
role of a court which is to provide a definitive interpretation of the law. 3 We make no distinction here between traders who are carrying out estate agency activities for the purpose of the Estate Agents Act 1979, and those who are not. 4 The guidance is not aimed at surveyors or conveyancers. However, since the regulations also apply to them, parts of the guidance may be relevant and helpful to them too.
