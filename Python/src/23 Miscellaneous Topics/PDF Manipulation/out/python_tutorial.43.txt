Example
 
Assume variable a holds 10 and variable b holds 20, then:
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
 
a 
=
 
21
 
b 
=
 
10
 
c 
=
 
0
 
 
c 
=
 
a 
+
 
b
 
print
 
"Line 1 
-
 
Value of c is "
,
 
c
 
c 
=
 
a 
-
 
b
 
print
 
"Line 2 
-
 
Value of c is "
,
 
c 
 
c 
=
 
a 
*
 
b
 
print
 
"Line 3 
-
 
Value of c is "
,
 
c 
 
c 
=
 
a 
/
 
b
 
print
 
"Line 4 
-
 
Value of c is "
,
 
c 
 
 
c 
=
 
a 
%
