relief
 
Specifies the appearance of a decorative border around the label. The 
default is FLAT; for other values.
 
text
 
To display one or more lines of text in a label widget, set 
this option 
to a string containing the text. Internal newlines ("
\
n") will force a 
line break.
 
textvariable
 
To slave the text displayed in a label widget to a control variable of 
class
 
StringVar
, set this option to that variable.
 
underline
 
You can displa
y an underline (_) below the nth letter of the text, 
counting from 0, by setting this option to n. The default is 
underline=
-
1, which means no underlining.
 
width
 
Width of the label in characters (not pixels!). If this option is not set, 
the label will be 
sized to fit its contents.
 
wraplength
 
You can limit the number of characters in each line by setting this 
option to the desired number. The default value, 0, means that lines 
will be broken only at newlines.
