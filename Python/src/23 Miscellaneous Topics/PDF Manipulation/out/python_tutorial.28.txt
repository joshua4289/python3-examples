Multiple Statements on a Single Line
 
The semicolon ( ; ) allows multiple statements on the single 
line given that neither 
statement starts a new code block. Here is a sample snip using the semicolon:
 
import
 
sys
;
 
x 
=
 
'foo'
;
 
sys
.
stdout
.
write
(
x 
+
 
'
\
n'
)
 
Multiple Statement Groups as Suites
 
A group of individual statements, which make a single code block ar
e called
 
suites
 
in 
Python. Compound or complex statements
,
 
such as if, while, def, and class
 
require a 
header line and a suite.
 
Header lines begin the statement (with the keyword) and terminate with a colon ( : 
) and are followed by one 
or more lines which make up the suite. For example:
 
if
 
expression 
:
 
 
   
suite
 
elif
 
expression 
:
 
 
   
suite 
 
else
 
:
 
 
   
suite
 
Command Line Arguments
 
M
any programs can be run 
to
 
provide you with some basic i
nformation about how 
they should be run. Python enables you to do this with 
-
h:
 
$ python

h
 
usage
:
 
python 
[
option
]
 
...
 
[

[

]
 
...
 
Options
 
and
 
arguments 
(
and
 
corresponding environment variables
):
 
-
c cmd 
:
 
program passed 
in
 
as
 
string
 
(
terminates option list
)
 
-
d     
:
 
debug output 
from
 
parser 
(
also PYTHONDEBUG
=
x
)
 
-
E     
:
 
ignore environment variables 
(
such 
as
 
PYTHONPATH
)
 
-
h     
:
 
print
 
this
 
help message 
and
 
exit
