file.seek(offset[,whence])
 
Description
 
The method
 
seek()
 
sets the file's current position at the offset. The whence argument 
is 
optional and defaults to 0, which means absolute file positioning, other values are 
1 which means seek relative to the current position and 2 means seek relative to the 
file's end.
 
There is no return value. Note that if the file is opened for appending usi
ng either 'a' 
or 'a+', any seek() operations will be undone at the next write.
 
If the file is only opened for writing in append mode using 'a', this method is 
essentially a no
-
op, but it remains useful for files opened in append mode with 
reading enabled (
mode 'a+').
