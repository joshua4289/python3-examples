1.9 There are also other important laws and regulations that may apply to you, which are not covered in this guidance. Annexe A lists some of them and provides links to further guidance. What do I need to do? 1.10 It is important that you read and understand the guidance to help you to comply with the law and treat consumers, business customers and competitors properly. 1.11 You should:  consider how the regulations apply to your property sales business5 if necessary, make changes to your business practices, and   ensure that your staff understand the regulations and comply with them, as your business may be held responsible for their actions. What happens if I don't comply with the law? 1.12 If you do not comply with the law you may face civil and/or criminal sanctions. For example you may face enforcement action by your local authority Trading Standards Service (or, in Northern Ireland, the 
Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment), or by another consumer enforcement body. See section 6 for more information on enforcement action. 1.13 In respect of your advertisements, both online and in print media, you could be subject to a published adjudication of the Advertising Standards Authority.65 You may find the guidance relevant to other parts of your business too, for example the regulations also apply to lettings and property management.  If you belong to a professional body, you may face its disciplinary procedures and/or expulsion from its membership. 6 All advertisers must adhere to the mandatory Advertising Codes. The Committee of Advertising Practice provides advice and guidance at www.cap.org.uk/The-Codes.
