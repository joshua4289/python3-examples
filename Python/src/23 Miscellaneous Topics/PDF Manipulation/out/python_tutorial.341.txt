Here, you have placed a basic e
-
mail in message, using a triple 
quote, taking care to 
format the headers correctly. An e
-
mail requires a
 
From
,
 
To
, and
 
Subject
 
header, 
separated from the body of the e
-
mail with a blank line.
 
To send the mail you use
 
smtpObj
 
to connect to the SMTP server on the local machine 
and then use
 
the
 
sendmail
 
method along with the message, the from address, and 
the destination address as parameters (even though the from and to addresses are 
within the e
-
mail itself, these aren't always used to route mail).
 
If you
 
a
re not running an SMTP server on
 
your local machine, you can 
use
 
smtplib
 
client to communicate with a remote SMTP server. Unless you
 
a
re using 
a webmail service (such as Hotmail or Yahoo! Mail), your e
-
mail provider 
must
 
have 
provided you with outgoing mail server details that you c
an supply them, as follows:
 
smtplib.SMTP('mail.your
-
domain.com', 25)
