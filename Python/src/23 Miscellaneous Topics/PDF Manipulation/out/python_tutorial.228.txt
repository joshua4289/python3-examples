Reading and
 
Writing Files
 
The
 
file
 
object provides a set of access methods to make our lives easier. We would 
see how to use
 
read()
 
and
 
write()
 
methods to read and write files.
 
The
 
write()
 
Method
 
The
 
write()
 
method writes any string to an open file. It is important
 
to note that 
Python strings can have binary data and not just text.
 
The write() method does not add a newline character ('
\
n') to the end of the string:
 
Syntax
 
fileObject.write(string);
 
Here, passed parameter is the content to be written into the opened 
file.
 
Example
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
 
# Open a file
 
fo = open("foo.txt", "wb")
 
fo.write( "Python is a great language.
\
nYeah its great!!
\
n");
 
 
# Close opend file
 
fo.close()
