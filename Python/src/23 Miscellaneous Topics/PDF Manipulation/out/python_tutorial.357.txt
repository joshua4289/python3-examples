XML is a portable, open source language that allows programmers to develop 
applications that can be read by other applications, regardless of operating system 
and/or developmen
tal language.
 
What is XML?
 
The Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language much like HTML or 
SGML. This is recommended by the World Wide Web Consortium and available as an 
open standard.
 
XML is extremely useful for keeping track of small to medium amounts of data without 
requiring a SQL
-
based backbone.
 
XML Pars
er Architectures and APIs:
 
The Python standard library provides a minimal but useful set of interfaces to work 
with XML.
 
The two most basic and broadly used APIs to XML data are the SAX and DOM 
interfaces.
 

 
Simple API for XML (SAX) :
 
Here, you register call
backs for events of 
interest and then let the parser proceed through the document. This is useful 
when your documents are large or you have memory limitations, it parses the 
file as it reads it from disk and the entire file is never stored in memory.
 

 
Docum
ent Object Model (DOM) API :
 
This is a World Wide Web Consortium 
recommendation wherein the entire file is read into memory and stored in a 
hierarchical (tree
-
based) form to represent all the features of an XML 
document.
 
SAX obviously can
no
t process 
information as fast as DOM can when working with 
large files. On the other hand, using DOM exclusively can really kill your resources, 
especially if used on a lot of small files.
 
SAX is read
-
only, while DOM allows changes to the XML file. Since these two d
ifferent 
APIs literally complement each other, there is no reason why you can
 
no
t use them 
both for large projects.
 
For all our XML code examples, let's use a simple XML file
 
movies.xml
 
as an input:
