Number data types store numeric values. They are immutable 
data types, means 
that changing the value of a number data type results in a newly allocated object.
 
Number objects are created when you assign a value to them. For example:
 
var1 
=
 
1
 
var2 
=
 
10
 
You can also delete the reference to a number object by using t
he
 
del
 
statement. The 
syntax of the 
del
 
statement is:
 
del
 
var1
[,
var2
[,
var3
[....,
varN
]]]]
 
You can delete a single object or multiple objects by using the 
del
 
statement. For 
example:
 
del
 
var
 
del
 
var_a
,
 
var_b
 
Python supports four different numerical types:
 

 
int (signed integers)
: 
They are 
often called just integers or ints, are positive 
or negative whole numbers with no decimal point.
 

 
long (long integers)
: 
Also called
 
longs, 
they 
are integers of unlimited size, 
written like integers and followed by an 
uppercase or lowercase L.
 

 
float (floating point real values)
 
: 
Also called 
floats, 
they 
represent real 
numbers and are written with a decimal point dividing the integer and 
fractional parts. Floats may also be in scientific notation, with E or e indicating
 
the power of 10 (2.5e2 = 2.5 x 10
2
 
= 250).
 

 
complex (complex numbers)
 
: are of the form a + bJ, where a and b are 
floats and J (or j) represents the square root of 
-
1 (which is an imaginary 
number). 
T
he real part of the number
 
is a
, and the imaginary part
 
is b
. 
Complex numbers are not used much in Python programming.
