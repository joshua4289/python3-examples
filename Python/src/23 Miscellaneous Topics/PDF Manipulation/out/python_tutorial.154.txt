Updating Tuples
 
Tuples are immutable which means you cannot update or change the values of tuple 
elements. You are able to take portions of existing tuples to create new tuples as the 
following example de
monstrates:
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
 
tup1 
=
 
(
12
,
 
34.56
);
 
tup2 
=
 
(
'abc'
,
 
'xyz'
);
 
 
# Following action is not valid for tuples
 
# tup1[0] = 100;
 
 
# So let's create a new tuple as follows
 
tup3 
=
 
tup1 
+
 
tup2
;
 
print
 
tup3
;
 
When the above code is executed, it produces 
the following result:
 
(
12
,
 
34.56
,
 
'abc'
,
 
'xyz'
)

Tuple Elements
 
Removing individual tuple elements is not possible. There is, of course, nothing wrong 
with putting together another tuple with the undesired elements discarded.
 
To explicitly remove
 
an entire tuple, just use the
 
del
 
statement. Fo
