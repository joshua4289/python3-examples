-
=
 
 
Subtract AND
 
It subtracts right operand from the left 
operand 
and assign the result to left 
operand
 
c 
-
= a is equivalent 
to c = c 
-
 
a
 
*=
 
 
Multiply AND
 
It multiplies right operand with the left 
operand and assign the result to left 
operand
 
c *= a is equivalent 
to c = c * a
 
/=
 
 
Divide AND
 
It divides left operand with the right 
operand and assign the result to left 
operand
 
c /= a is equivalent 
to c = c / a
 
%=
 
 
Modulus AND
 
It takes modulus using two operands and 
assi
gn the result to left operand
 
c %= a is equivalent 
to c = c % a
 
**=
 
 
Exponent AND
 
Performs exponential (power) calculation 
on operators and assign value to the left 
operand
 
c **= a is equivalent 
to c = c ** a
 
//=
 
 
Floor 
Division
 
It p
erforms floor division on operators and 
assign value to the left operand
 
c //= a is equivalent 
to c = c // a
 
Example
 
Assume variable a holds 10 and variable b holds 20, then:
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
 
a 
=
 
21
 
b 
=
 
10
 
c 
=
 
0
 
 
c 
=
 
a 
+
 
b
 
print
 
"Line 1 
-
 
Value of c is "
,
