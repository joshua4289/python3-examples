file.fileno
()
 
Returns the integer file descriptor that is used by the underlying 
implementation to request I/O operations from the operating system.
 
4
 
file.isatty()
 
Returns True if the file is c
onnected to a tty(
-
like) device, else False.
 
5
 
file.next()
 
Returnss the next line from the file each time it is being called.
 
6
 
file.read([size])
 
Reads at most size bytes from the file (less if the read hits EOF before 
obtaining size bytes).
 
7
 
file.readline([size])
 
Reads one entire line from the file. A trailing newline character is kept in the 
string.
 
8
 
file.readlines([sizehint])
 
Reads until EOF using readline() and ret
urn a list containing the lines. If the 
optional sizehint argument is present, instead of reading up to EOF, whole 
lines totalling approximately sizehint bytes (possibly after rounding up to an 
internal buffer size) are read.
 
9
 
file.seek(offset[,whence])
 
Sets the file's current position.
 
10
 
file.tell()
 
Returns the file's current position
 
11
 
file.truncate([size])
 
Truncates the file's size. If the optional size argument is present, the file is 
truncated to (at most) that size.
 
12
 
file.write(str)
 
Writes a string to the file. There is no return value.
 
13
 
file.writelines(sequence)
 
Writes a sequence of strings to the file. The sequence can
 
be any iterable 
object producing strings, typically a list of strings.
 
 
Let us go through them briefly:
