jump
 
This option controls what happens when a user drags the 
slider
. Normally (jump=0), every small drag of the slider 
causes the command callback to be called. If you set this 
option to 1, the callback isn't called until the user releases the 
mouse button.
 
orient
 
Set orient=HORIZONTAL for a horizontal scrollbar, 
orient=
VERTICAL for a vertical one.
 
repeatdelay
 
This option controls how long button 1 has to be held down in 
the trough before the slider starts moving in that direction 
repeatedly. Default is repeatdelay=300, and the units are 
milliseconds.
 
repeatinterval
 
repeatinterval

The color of the trough.
 
width
 
Width of the scrollbar (its y dimension if horizontal, and its x 
dimension i
f vertical). Default is 16.

Methods
 
Description
 
get()
 
Returns two numbers (a, b) describing the current position of the 
slider. The a value gives the position of the left or top edge of the 
slider, for 
horizontal and vertical scrollbars respectively; the b value 
gives the position of the right or bottom edge.
 
set ( first, last )
 
To connect a scrollbar to another widget w, set w's xscrollcommand 
or yscrollcommand to the scrollbar's set() method. The 
arguments 
have the same meaning as the values returned by the get() 
method.
