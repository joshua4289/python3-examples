Let us take again same example as above which passes two values using HTML FORM 
and submit button. We 
use same CGI script hello_get.py to handle this i
n
put.
 
<form
 
action
=
"/cgi
-
bin/hello_get.py"
 
method
=
"post"
>
 
First Name: 
<input
 
type
=
"text"
 
name
=
"first_name"
><br
 
/>
 
Last Name: 
<input
 
type
=
"text"
 
name
=
"last_name"
 
/>
 
 
<input
 
type
=
"submit"
 
value
=
"Submit"
 
/>
 
</form>
 
Here is the actual output of the above form. You enter First and Last Name and then 
click submit button to see the result.
 
First Name:
 
 
Last Name:
 
 
 
Bottom of Form
 

 
Checkboxes are used when more than one option is required to be selected.
 
Here is example HTML code for a form with two checkboxes:
 
<form
 
action
=
"/cgi
-
bin/checkbox.cgi"
 
method
=
"POST"
 
target
=
"_blank"
>
 
<input
 
type
=
"checkbox"
 
name
=
"maths"
 
value
=
"on"
 
/>
 
Maths
 
<input
 
type
=
"checkbox"
 
name
=
"physics"
 
value
=
"on"
 
/>
 
Physics
 
<input
 
type
=
"submit"
 
value
=
"Select Subject"
 
/>
 
</form>
 
The result of this code is the following form:
 
 
Maths
 
 
Physics
 
 
Bottom of Form
 
Below is checkbox.cgi script to handle input given by web browser for checkbox 
button.
