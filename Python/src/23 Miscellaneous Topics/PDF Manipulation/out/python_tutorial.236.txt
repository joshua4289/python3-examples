Description
 
The method
 
close()
 
closes the opened file. A closed file cannot be read or written any more. Any 
operation, which requires 
that the file be opened will raise a
 
ValueError
 
after the file has been closed. 
Calling close() more than once is allowed.
 
Python automatically closes a file when the reference object of a file is reassigned to another file. It is 
a good practice to use th
e close() method to close a file.
