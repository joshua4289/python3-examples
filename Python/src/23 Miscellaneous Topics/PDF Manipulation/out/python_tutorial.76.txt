Example
 
The following program uses a nested for loop to find the prime numbers from 2 to 
100:
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
 
i 
=
 
2
 
while
(
i 
<
 
100
):
 
   
j 
=
 
2
 
   
while
(
j 
<=
 
(
i
/
j
)):
 
      
if
 
not
(
i
%
j
):
 
break
 
      
j 
=
 
j 
+
 
1
 
   
if
 
(
j 
>
 
i
/
j
)
 
:
 
print
 
i
,
 
" is prime"
 
   
i 
=
 
i 
+
 
1
 
 
print
 
"Good bye!"
 
When the above code is executed, it produces following result:
 
2
 
is

3
 
is
 
prime
 
5
 
is
