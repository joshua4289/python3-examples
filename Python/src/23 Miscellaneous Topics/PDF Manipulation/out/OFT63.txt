Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 (the UTCCRs) Require you, when using standard contract terms (subject to certain exceptions), to meet the test of fairness, for example:  to express terms fully, clearly and legibly, giving due prominence to terms that might disadvantage the consumer and  to respect consumers' legitimate interests, not taking advantage of their 
weaker bargaining position, or lack of experience, in deciding what their rights and obligations shall be. For further information, see www.oft.gov.uk/about-the-oft/legal-powers.
