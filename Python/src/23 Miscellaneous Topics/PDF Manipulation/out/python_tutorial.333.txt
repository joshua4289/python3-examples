OperationalError
 
Subclass of DatabaseError that refers to errors such as the
 
loss 
of a connection to the database. These errors are generally 
outside of the control of the Python scripter.
 
IntegrityError
 
Subclass of DatabaseError for situations that would damage the 
relational integrity, such as uniqueness constraints or foreign 
keys.
 
InternalError
 
Subclass of DatabaseError that refers to errors internal to the 
database module, such as a cursor no longer being active.
 
ProgrammingError
 
Subclass of DatabaseError that refers to errors such as a bad 
table name and other things that 
can safely be blamed on you.
 
NotSupportedError
 
Subclass of DatabaseError that refers to trying to call 
unsupported functionality.
 
 
Your Python scripts should handle these errors, but before using any of the above 
exceptions, make sure your MySQLdb has 
support for that exception. You can get 
more information about them by reading the DB API 2.0 specification.
