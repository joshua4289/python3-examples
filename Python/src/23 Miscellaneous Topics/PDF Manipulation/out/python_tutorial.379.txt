Entry
 
The Entry widget is used to accept single
-
line text strings from a user.
 

 
If you want to display multiple lines of
 
text that can be edited, then you should 
use the
 
Text
 
widget.
 

 
If you want to display one or more lines of text that cannot be modified by the 
user, then you should use the
 
Label
 
widget.
