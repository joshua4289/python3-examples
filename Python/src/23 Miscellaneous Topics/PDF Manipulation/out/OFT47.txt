- Take note of the number and size of rooms, whether or not the property is on mains electricity and sewerage, how the property is heated, its general condition, any significant and visible 
structural defects, and other features that prospective buyers 
need to know about in order to decide whether or not to view a property. - Be observant. During an inspection you may observe things that 
put you on notice that further enquiries might be needed. This 
would include, for example, the fact that a property is (sub)let or 
is occupied by someone who may have rights to remain in the 
property after a sale. You may also notice other facts such as applications for planning permission displayed at nearby 
premises, footpaths over the land itself or evidence of flooding. - You should make sure you are in a position where you can 
answer accurately the reasonable queries of prospective purchasers in relation to such matters. - Draw on your professional knowledge of the local market, for 
example the prices of comparable properties that have sold recently in the area and any notable local features. For example, where a property is next to a mobile phone mast, a railway line, a nuclear power station or sewage plant, these facts must not be 
hidden or left out. You should not, for instance, edit photos of the property to remove undesirable features. - It is clearly material information whether a property is freehold or 
leasehold, but you may also need to highlight particular features 
of the title, such as the length of term left on a lease and any 
unusual payment obligations under the lease or surprising and 
onerous restrictive covenants (if known). - Consider whether there is anything about the property and its 
sale that you should know but do not, or which makes you think 
that something is not quite right or that there may be a problem with you marketing it? If there is, then check things out.  Check things out:
