Is this guidance for me? 1.3 The guidance applies to you if, as part of your business, you  supply marketing or other services related to the sale of property or land (for example if you are an estate agent, a buyers' agent, an 
internet property retailer, a property auctioneer or a solicitor offering 
services that count as estate agency work), and/or  sell property or land (for example if you are a property developer that markets and sells your own developments), and/or  buy property or land for resale (for example if you are a company that buys up 'below market value' property as an investment opportunity), and/or  provide some ancillary service related to any of the above. 1 Statutory Instruments 2008/1277 and 2008/1276, respectively. 2 The regulations are based on European Union directives, which, in relation to real estate matters, require a minimum level of protection to be provided across all member states. Substantially the same rules therefore apply across the European Union, although some member states may have adopted more restrictive legislation.
