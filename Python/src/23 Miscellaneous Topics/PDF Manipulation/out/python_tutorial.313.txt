Passing Drop Down Box Data to CGI Program
 
Drop Down Box is used when we have many options available but only one or two 
will be selected.
 
Here is example HTML code for a form with 
one drop down box:
 
<form
 
action
=
"/cgi
-
bin/dropdown.py"
 
method
=
"post"
 
target
=
"_blank"
>
 
<select
 
name
=
"dropdown"
>
 
<option
 
value
=
"Maths"
 
selected
>
Maths
</option>
 
<option
 
value
=
"Physics"
>
Physics
</option>
 
</select>
 
<input
 
type
=
"submit"
 
value
=
"Submit"
/>
 
</form>
 
The result of this code is the following form:
 
  
 
 
Bottom of Form
 
Below is dropdown.py script to handle input given by web browser.
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
 
# Import modules for CGI handling 
 
import
 
cgi
,
 
cgitb 
 
 
# Create instance of FieldStorage 
 
form 
=
 
cgi
.
FieldStorage
()
 
 
 
# Get data from fields
