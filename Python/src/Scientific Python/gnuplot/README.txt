Gnuplot examples require:
1) gnuplot.exe application to be installed
2) install the gnuplot-py python package

To install gnuplot.exe run:
    extract-gnuplot.exe-zip.py
from the scripts directory

This will install gnuplot.exe in the directory 'scripts\gnuplot\binary'.  
The PATH env variable then needs to be changed accordingly.

In these examples I've used setup.py to change the PATH environment variable.
